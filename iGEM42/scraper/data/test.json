In an effort to combat with colorectal carcinoma, we aim to use genetically modified Bacillus subtilis to execute targeted drug delivery to cancer cells in the digestive tract, offering an advantage of generating minimal adverse effect on normal colon epithelial cells. Targeting is achieved by expressing RPMrel, a colon tumor specific binding peptide, on the cell wall using a LytC cell wall binding system. The anti-tumor cytokine, bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP-2), is synthesized and secreted out from the bacteria with the help of a signaling peptide fused to the protein. To control the timing and amount of BMP2 release, two regulatory systems, xylose-inducible system and ydcE/ydcD toxin-antitoxin system are introduced to minimize the harmful effect from BMP2 overdose.",

Further the dynamics of elicitor interaction with the bacteria in a flow stream and concomitant product release have also been a part of the study.

Taq polymerase will be attached to this peptide via a thermolabile bond allowing the peptide to be cleaved using just temperature. The polymerase has furthermore been mutated in such a way to avoid interactions with nucleic acids, thus diminishing the effects it may have in the bacterial host cell. This system can be adopted and enhanced to produce libraries or large scales of peptides/drugs without the high price tag attached to then be distributed to large communities that otherwise cannot afford the cost of research nor treatment.",

Therefore we are developing a bioremediation tool using Escherichia coli to absorb and bind arsenic and remove it from its surrounding environment. Natural and synthetic peptides are employed to sequester the toxic ions and a pump knockout ensures that arsenic stays in the cell. Measurement of growth capacity of the engineered strain in arsenic containing media and quantitative analysis of arsenic sequestration will be performed. Characterization and integration of an arsenic-responsive promoter will allow the sequestration system to dynamically adjust to current conditions. A simple, well-implemented system for biosequestration of arsenic may become part of a solution to a problem denying access to clean drinking water for many.",

To achieve this goal we use the collateral effect of the AOX enzyme (Alternative oxidase) mainly designed to generate heat in response to a cold-shock, using the hybB promoter which increases the bacteria growth at temperatures below 20C.Finally we design a prototype device with a better cold shock promoter (CspA) developed by UNAM-CINVESTAV Team in 2010, in order to give our E. coli an 'Intelligent Coat', which means that not only survives a cold-shock but is also able to keep up with its duties, due of improving their expression mechanisms at low temperature.",

Once it was decided that the opportunities presented by the organism appeared to outweigh the challenges involved in working with it, a foundational library of parts was built and tested within the organism.

Infants in particular are susceptible to methemoglobinemia, also known as 'blue baby syndrome', when formula is reconstituted using water contaminated with nitrates. By combining the red fluorescent protein coding region with a nitrate sensitive promoter, we are developing an inexpensive, simple, visual test for nitrate contaminated water.

Although much effort has gone into the production of ethanol, other biofuels, such as butanol, are superior. Butanol has a higher energy content, is less volatile, and is safer to use than ethanol. To develop strains of bacteria that produce high levels of 1-butanol we have introduced the genes coding for a biochemical pathway from Clostridium acetobutylicum into a mutant E. coli strain that produces a high level of NADH. The combination of these chemical pathways is predicted to increase the level of butanol production. Our second project, the Bacterial Etch-a-Sketch, features a complex network of gene expression and repression that enables a lawn of bacteria to respond to 470nm light. This task presents many engineering challenges: the bacteria need to be sensitive enough to respond to a laser pulse, yet selective enough to use in ambient lighting.",

Our \"Bio-dosimeter\" consists of two points: damage tolerance and radiation detection. To introduce the tolerance to E. coli, we are trying to put in some radiation resistance genes from Deinococcus radiodurans. For the detection of the radiation, we are trying to connect the native DNA damage response system of E. coli to production of pigment lycopene as a reporter.\r\n Now, we are attempting to assess its tolerance to various types of DNA damage and to evaluate DNA damage detection more clearly",

BioMortar begins with a much improved version of IMPtools, which uses an algorithm over a network generated by the KEGG database, to determine the optimal metabolic pathway according to specified conditions. At this point, it accesses the DNA sequences for each recommended enzyme for each reaction and searches the BioBrick database for related gene sequences. Then, BioMORTAR designs and displays the advised, usable plasmid(s) in BioBrick format for the user.  Finally, the program models the growth of the organism, with the addition of the new metabolic pathway(s). By automating the design process, BioMORTAR streamlines the process of designing bacteria with new metabolic processes.",

A major stumbling block however, is often an inability to express functional protein.  This situation is difficult to manage and troubleshoot as it is often unclear why expression is failing. We have designed a system that can accurately and visually report whether a gene is being transcribed and/or translated. The system also differentiates whether expression is failing due to misfolding in the periplasm or cytoplasm.  In the case of misfolding, our system can also fine tune expression levels of a given protein to optimize production, increasing the likelihood of obtaining functional protein.  To further understand protein misfolding we have built an equation-based, multivariant model of inclusion body formation.  Finally, we used a series of podcasts to explore the social implications of our project in the context of the growing synthetic biology industry.",

        "abstract": "Oil sands, consisting of a mixture of clay, sand and bitumen represent a significant fraction of remaining petroleum reserves.  However, extracting the hydrocarbons requires large volumes of water which are then contaminated with naphthenic acids, heavy metals and residual hydrocarbons.  These 'tailings' are acutely toxic to higher organisms, though some bacteria and algae can survive in these environs.  Our knowledge of metabolic pathways capable of degrading such contaminants (bioremediation) is limited.  However, the known pathways tend to be slow and inefficient.  The breakdown of many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons generates a common intermediate, catechol that is further degraded to Acetyl-CoA.  Metabolic channeling is an effect whereby intermediates are shuttled between enzymes in a pathway circumventing free diffusion into the cytosol.  Here, we present a design, modeling and baseline experiments aimed at demonstrating optimization of catechol degradation using the principle of metabolic channeling in an E. coli proof of concept system.",

Synthetic biology holds the potential to transform the recycling industry by altering the economics of waste processing.  To this end, we are engineering a model organism, E. coli, to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common plastic found in soda bottles, carpets, clothing, food packaging, and even space blankets. We engineer and express a gene originally found in leaf-branch compost encoding a cutinase enzyme whose product degrades PET into two products: ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.  Through rational and directed evolution of the E. coli chassis, we also create strains that utilize the breakdown product ethylene glycol as their sole carbon source.",

Synthetic biology offers great opportunity for biosensors, however current designs require hours before useful output. To tackle this issue in the field, it's crucial that our project can respond in minutes, hence we have engineered a fast, modular sensor framework. This allows detection of a range of different parasites, and may also be used as an environmental tool for mapping their spread. We have developed two new technologies that enable our modular input/output - a novel cell surface biosensor, customisable for specific parasitic proteases, linked through quorum-sensing to a new 'fast-response' module capable of producing a detectable output in minutes. To demonstrate the concept, we've designed and fabricated B. subtilis to give a striking colour readout upon detecting the waterborne Schistosoma parasite which affects 200 million people worldwide.",

Specifically, we have generated several TetR and pTet promoter variants using site-directed mutagenesis, and characterized their respective interactions using fluorescent reporter assays and MITOMI-based microfluidic devices. In addition, we are developing a proof-of-concept high-throughput measurement system based on bacterial cell lysis to in vivo select desirable variant protein-DNA interactions . This system is based on a repression cascade, in which TetR binding to the pTet promoter element triggers cell lysis in an affinity-dependent manner, enabling us to collect the plasmids of suitable TetR variants for sequence analysis and downstream processing.\"",

Fortunately, nature has provided us with robust, cellular systems capable of governing the autonomous formation of complex structures. To pursue control of multicellular systems, we engineered a number of ligand-receptor signaling mechanisms: the Notch-Delta juxtacrine signaling pathway and an assortment of G-Protein Coupled Receptors. Both signaling systems were modified to activate orthogonal genetic circuits, allowing for processing and integration of numerous signals. In order to facilitate and maintain pattern formation, we introduced cadherin, a natural intercellular glue. To understand and predict multicellular behavior, we developed a simulation framework based on the Synthetic Biology Open Language and CompuCell 3D modeling environment. Our models motivated several circuit designs we subsequently tested in the laboratory. Altogether, our developments establish a paradigm for manipulation of intercellular communication systems to drive self-organization of tissues.\"",

We selected an OxyR-responsive promoter (HemH) and a thermo-sensitive riboswitch (derived from Listeria) as detectors for ROS and temperature, respectively.The OxyR-responsive promoter is used to drive transcription of the Listera thermo-sensitive riboswitch coupled to a Cre/Lox system which, when activated, removes a double-terminator sequence and allows constitutive transcription of the reporter molecule. This system may be further modified and adapted to various applications, including early detection of colon cancer.\"",

Proteorhodopsin, the inspiration for our motto is a proton pump, native to marine bacteria, that uses light to generate proton gradient across the cell membrane. This leads to Photophosphorylation, as the proton gradient drives ATP-synthase to produce ATP. We have designed a cloning vector containing a Proteorhodopsin generator which confers a survival advantage to transformants in nutrient limiting conditions. And thus, we propose a novel screening technique that uses metabolic stress to screen for transformants in the presence of light. In addition, using the stress alleviation due to proteorhodopsin activity, we intend to enhance the yield of recombinant proteins and substrate consumption efficiency.\"",

        "abstract": "The use of recombinant protein production using E. coli-based expression systems has revolutionized the fields of biotechnology and medicine.  However, the ability to utilize such proteins hinges upon their capacity to be isolated from their expression systems.  Our project aims to create an all-in-one protein expression and purification system using BioBrick standards to greatly simplify protein production for synthetic biologists, reducing the time and cost involved in standard protein purification methods.  Our method uses a novel combination of two systems: secretion and display.  By fusing two tags to the protein it can be secreted into the expression media, and subsequently directed to bind to the outside of the cell.  To collect the pure proteins, cells only need to be spun down and then resuspended in an elution buffer, releasing the protein of interest. Our research exhibits the utility of synthetic biology for developing new techniques that improve upon established practices.",

A project was designed to synthesize three chemicals which compose a significant portion of the aroma and coloration of the spice saffron: safranal, picrocrocin, and crocin. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was chosen as the chassis because of its photosynthetic nature and native production of the substrate, zeaxanthin. It was proposed that the cloning of two genes ZCD and UGTCs2, would be sufficient to make the compounds in this organism.  These two were cloned into E. coli in conjunction with the genes necessary to produce zeaxanthin.  ZCD was successfully cloned into E. coli with the aid of a fusion protein to minimize the presence of inclusion bodies.  This result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE followed by trypsin digestion and LC-MS/MS. With this groundwork laid, future work can produce a biosynthetic alternative to saffron.",

For example, controlling the expression of a toxin would allow creating a “suicidal bacterium” that would bring on its own death outside the specified temperature range.

To accomplish this, we will use a native promoter (lrtA) that normally functions as a light-regulated promoter in cyanobacteria. We will insert it into a plasmid together with the luxCDABE cassette. The cassette contains the luciferase enzyme and enzymes necessary for regeneration of its substrates.\r\nThe final goal is to make cyanobacteria (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7002) glow because cyanobacteria perform photosynthesis and therefore do not need supplied nutrients. First, the experiment is carried out in E. coli and afterwards the plasmid is transferred to the cyanobacteria. Both of the systems will subsequently be thoroughly analyzed to determine important characteristics of the system including kinetics and efficiency of the expression levels.\r\nTo achieve this quantification we will collaborate with a fellow Physics student at University of Copenhagen.",

Our team implemented broadly applicable methods to optimize biological systems through directed evolution, light-regulated gene expression, and computer aided protein design. We characterized light-inducible protein expression systems for multichromatic tuning of biological pathways. To provide an inexpensive method for tuning gene expression with light, we developed a tablet application that is freely available. We also used computer-aided design to develop proteins that more effectively bind isotypes of the flu protein Hemagglutinin. Finally, we implemented a continuous culture device (turbidostat) in order to apply directed evolution to the metabolism of ethylene glycol in E. coli. We have termed the research conducted this year “Apptogenetics” as all projects utilize purpose-built computational applications for biological research.",

By this purpose, designing a wound dressing which is natural, non-toxic, and biodegradable and imitating the actual wound healing mechanism which is forming on open wounds in mammalian tissues is our main purpose.By this wound covering, we will fasten the healing process, and protect the wounded area from infectious agents. In this wound dressing, there will be 4 layers including polyurethane layers and our bacteria colonies. Our bacteria colonies will be capable of synthesizing human epidermal growth factor and keratinocyte growth factor. The communication between these bacteria colonies will be dependent on quorum sensing molecules.",

One strain of E. coli carrying the LuxI and LuxAB genes was trapped in hydrogel at one end of microfluidic channel.  Another strain of E. coli carrying a LuxR operon attached with a GFP reporter gene and LuxCDE gene was similarly trapped at the other end of the channel. Depending on the direction of flow, one group of E. coli will be downstream of the other and therefore capable of receiving a chemical signal.  Acting as an analog of zener diode, this device is capable of controlling the direction of communication between the E. coli. The orthogonal visual responses, one fluorescent and one luminescent, should be clear indicators of which way communication took place. This device is a novel member of the growing toolkit available to perform logic operations with living systems.\"",

        "abstract": "\"Our work aims at implementing the engineering concept of closed-loop control in E. coli, exploiting quorum sensing. As a proof of concept, we designed a simple genetic controller that regulates the concentration of 3OC6-HSL signalling molecule around  a user-defined set-point. The controlled variable (3OC6-HSL) increases as a function of the exogenous anhydroTetracycline input, that triggers LuxI expression. The controller senses the 3OC6-HSL concentration and activates the production of AiiA, that degrades it.To observe the desired behaviour, a fine tuning of the system was necessary.  The transcriptional/translational strength of the regulatory elements (promoter+RBS in several combinations) and the enzyme activities were measured and exploited to identify a mathematical model able to predict the behaviour of the controlled system. These predictions made possible an in silico rational fine tuning of the circuit: the most promising modules were selected and assembled into the final circuit, avoiding a cost and time expensive combinatorial approach. \"",

Distinct from linear DNA or RNA scaffolds in the traditional sense, the membrane protein system expands the dimension of reaction space, making possible the framework of numerous complex reactions on the two-dimensional plane, for example, switchable or circular reactions. In such a device, the membrane replaces DNA or RNA scaffolds as an extensive surface for proteins to anchor without limitation of expression amount. More importantly, by gathering the downstream enzymes through signal regulation, the reaction can be accelerated sharply. Besides, products can be transported much more efficiently from the inside to the outside of the cell in that the enzymes are tied to the membrane proteins. Hence the membrane is where the magic happens.",

As an example we are developing a cell-free bisphenol A (BPA) biosensor based on a coupled enzyme reaction fused to S-layer proteins for everyday use. BPA is a supposedly harmful substance which is e.g. used in the production of polycarbonate. To detect BPA it is degraded by a fusion protein under formation of NAD+ which is detected by a NAD+-dependent enzymatic reaction with a molecular beacon.",

These crystal proteins are toxic to certain types of mosquitoes and are not pathogenic to mammals. We designed a temperature-dependent genetic circuit expressing high levels of crystal proteins at room temperature only, thus production does not occur at incubation temperature 37 C. In order to make an environmentally safe insecticide, our design also incorporates a genetic circuit controlling the population size of E. coli. This intelligent terminator is not limited to mosquitos, as it can be custom fitted with different cry genes to other insect species. Currently, with more than one hundred crystal proteins targeting various insect species, our design may potentially serve as a promising pest control solution in the future.",

We plan to try and simplify this process by separating commercially important compounds using a biological system instead of traditional chemical methods which can be very resource intensive and time consuming. We also plan to develop a high-throughput system for screening of drugs which act on the Estrogen receptor using E. coli.

With annual production exceeding 100 million tons (2010), it creates an issue of PET waste. In Western countries less than 70% of PET production is recovered by recycling. Biological processes play no role so far, only expensive chemical processes are applicable yet. PET waste left to erosion in the environment creates nanoparticles which tend to accumulate toxic substances. This poses a growing environmental threat and a serious health risk. Thus, developing new methods for PET degradation has become an urgent issue. Team TUD designed a bacterial recycling system that uses PET waste as a resource for synthesis of new chemical compounds. The proposed solution pursues PET decomposition into its monomers, transportation into E. coli and leading via terephthalic acid (TPA) to a high-value end product. The latter’s specification is determined by the inserted enzymes to build new metabolic pathways.",

Nonetheless, the increasing demand of high fructose syrup has become a rising threat to most sugar companies. Our project expects to apply synthetic biology to use sugar, obtained from sugarcane, in an industrial sugar-fructose process intending to make it easier and more profitable. The new genetic construct will be able to immobilize invertase by fusing it to bacterial natural membrane protein fragments using a technique for cell surface display. This system will catalyze the transformation of sucrose into fructose directly, without the need of any chemical or mechanical purification process to obtain the enzyme, reducing the amount of unit operations, and cutting production costs. Also, we will use the same principle to immobilize cellulase, converting cellulose from bagasse into something useful to produce biofuels. \"",

Our product and system is called “the traffic-light stress sensor”. It is constructed to express fluorescent proteins of different colors in response to different stimuli which are inhibiting growth or harming production. We aim to build a sensor that can detect shear stress and low oxygen levels. We believe these two stresses are critical in a bioprocessing environment. We are applying e.coli’s native or modified promoters for DegP, Spy and NarK in order to induce transcription. Ideally the cells responses to stressed conditions should be sufficiently accurate, reliable and rapid for the stresses to be detected and mitigated.",

It is a novel proposal of synthetic ecology, based on the use of an efficient photosynthesizer (the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus) modified to become an exporter of sucrose and diel switch of the activity of Aliivibrio fischeri, a marine bacterium widely known for its bioluminescent properties in response to quorum sensing signals. Our modified cyanobacteria feed the population of A. fischeri through a transporter protein and produce AHL to induce bioluminescence in response to the activity of a photosensitive operator, which would activate only at night. We also have tried to transform different microalgae with bioluminescence genes to test their effectiveness. We look forward to develop an efficient and autosufficient environmentally friendly biolamp, with potential application to cover the illumination needs of many infrastructure sectors.",

The system consists of two types of genetically modified E. coli: the random signal generating E. coli ('Brush E. coli') and the color generating E. coli ('Paint E. coli'). Brush E. coli possesses genes (lasI, luxI, rhlI, and cinI) in its gDNA that produce quorum molecules. On the other hand, by modified Cre-loxP mechanism, gDNA is randomly set to secrete only one of the four types of quorum molecules. Paint E.coli possesses plasmids that express one of four colors (red, cyan, yellow, and green) by producing fluorescent proteins in response to the type of quorum it receives from Brush E.coli. As Paint E.coli expresses corresponding fluorescence in response, it also produces quorum molecule that is identical to the inducer to start propagation. Ultimately, using this system, the 'random' contribution of cells will create art on an LB plate.",

However, these devices have often been limited by the requirement of a high cell density at the target site in order to achieve higher efficiencies. To overcome this, we devise an inducible self- assembling system in Escherichia coli utilizing L-aspartate (L-Asp) chemotaxis. Our system consists of two cell types: 'guiders' and 'workers'. When exposed to a signal, the former discharge and generate a signal-centered spatial L-Asp gradient, and the latter lose motility by repression of a flagellum-regulating gene (cheZ). These cells remain at the source of the signal and cannot escape. Using E. coli-derived stress-sensitive promoters cloned de novo, we provide evidence that our system enables auto-assembly and localization after exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Since the input can be varied to other inducible promoters, we anticipate that our system to greatly enhance the potential of engineered cellular machineries.",

Precise control of the time of delay of this entire process, one can pre-set the time of expression of genetic functions in a predicable manner. By using Asyl-Homoserine Lactones(AHLs) that can freely pass through the cell membrane as signal molecules, the time can be shared, in real time, by all cells within the pot. This way, receiver (timer) cells would take the action all at once in right timing, minimizing the distribution in each cell's response time. This year, we are trying to make a platform for generating an animated pictures using series of new timer cells we have constructed.",

        "abstract": "The possibility of specifically targeting bacteria to biological or abiotic surfaces is a promising technology of potential use in therapy, pest control and bioremediation, among others. However, since in most cases bacteria are not drawn towards their targets, the possibility of specific interaction is limited to those bacterial cells that randomly collide with the surface, thus requiring a high bacterial population to achieve efficient targeting. On the other hand, most bacteria are specifically attracted by gradients of a variety of chemicals, thus achieving high cell densities in the areas where the chemoattractants are present at higher concentration. The aim of 'Bacterial Crowding' is to exploit chemotaxis for directing a relatively small population of bacteria to interact efficiently with a non-diffusible target exposed on a biotic or abiotic surface.",

B. subtilis served as our model organism because it does not naturally posses a CRISPR mechanism. This should demostrate that the S. thermophilus CRISPR1/Cas system can be transferred into Bacillus subtilis and provide heterologous protection against plasmid transformation and phage infection.",

The Stanford team has applied synthetic biology to a longstanding objective of immunotherapy: restoration and maintenance of homeostasis.  Stanford’s Escherichia coli-based probiotic will polarize T cell differentiation along antagonistic fates - immunosuppressive Treg and inflammatory Th17 phenotypes - in response to local conditions.  Our device design consists of two parts: one that modulates deleterious Treg-driven immunosuppression and another that engages Th17-mediated inflammation.  Through specific sensors and effectors, therapy will oscillate between dampening pathologic inflammation and immunosuppression until a balance in the local T cell population is achieved.  Securing such homeostasis between these populations has therapeutic implications for autoimmune disorders like IBD, HIV and cancer. We envision our novel and directed probiotic therapy for IBD as acting at the interface between commensal bacteria and human lymphocytes, integrating cutting-edge immunology with synthetic biology.",

In our project, we aim to replace such analog system with a phototunable cascade, which can trigger a measurable output (e.g. gene expression) according to the wavelengths, intensities, and durations of a light source in a quantitative manner.  In the long run, this system could be further modified to convert light into other types of output, such as osmolality and electric current.\"",

Imagine if a complex neurological state such as the desire to eat could be influenced by an engineered strain of intestinal microflora.  In this regard, Peptide Tyrosine Tyrosine (PYY) and its associated molecules offer a unique opportunity for synthetic biologists.  These peptides permit microorganisms native to the gastrointestinal tract to interact with the central nervous system and to influence the perception of hunger.  The Citadel-Charleston Team is working to express the PYY family of peptides in E.coli, to implement a secretion pathway for those peptides, and to ensure that their expression is strictly controlled by means of a cellular population limit.",

In this project we worked with light responsive promoters, a novel biofilm-forming synthetic biology chassis, E. coli Nissle 1917, and novel biobricks including several designed for biofilm dispersal and fluorescent reporters with wider utility than GFP. The main aims of our project can be separated into three light-controlled components: the designed sculpting of biofilms; 3D printing for encapsulation of cells; and the controlled modular synthesis of a variety of products. We expect this technology to have applications for material synthesis and compound manufacture in remote locations, for example outer space.\"",

We are BioBricking several metal binding peptides, expressing them in E. coli, and characterizing their ability to nucleate QDs from cadmium salts. In addition, since cadmium is dangerous to the environment, we will create QDs using less toxic metals such as zinc. We are also building a manufacturing 'tuning' device that will sense specific light wavelengths emitted by nucleated QDS and activate antibiotic resistance.\"",

Our project involved streamlining and providing additional functionality to a recently published synchronized oscillatory circuit, in an attempt to reproduce and further characterize its dynamics. Our genetic circuit consists of modified (and BioBricked) elements of the Vibrio fischeri lux quorum sensing system composed to form interconnected positive and negative feedback loops, which dynamically regulate the expression of GFP. In order to provide our E. coli host with the right environment required for population-wide oscillations, we designed and manufactured a custom flow-chamber capable of maintaining a defined cell population while independently varying the growth conditions. The chamber was specifically designed for time-lapse studies with a fluorescence microscope. We detected synchronized oscillatory gene expression under zero-flow conditions, suggesting an unexpected level of robustness. This should facilitate its integration with more advanced genetic circuits.\"",

Then target protein can be located either inside or outside the empty shell by fusing the protein with signal sequences, using a novel and convenient assembly standard compatible with the RFC 10. Onto this platform, artificial organelles with different functions can be constructed. With enzymes or binding proteins inside the shell, different nanoreactors or nanoreservoirs can be produced. Modifications outside the shell can be applied to build multi-protein super-complexes or facilitate downstream purification with affinity tags.

The objective of this project is to engineer the cinnamaldehyde biosynthetic pathway into E. coli to develop an inexpensive and readily available source of this compound. By introducing the genes encoding phenylalanine ammonia lyase, cinnamate-CoA ligase, and cinnamoyl-CoA reductase, it should be possible to produce cinnamaldehyde from available phenylalanine in E. coli. Once we have proven that we can produce cinnamaldehyde in E. coli, we will engineer cinnamaldehyde production in duckweed, a small aquatic plant. Because mosquito larvae feed on duckweed detritus, the engineered plant will serve as an excellent vehicle to deliver cinnamaldehyde for mosquito control.",

Having a unique communication substance means there's no need to understand how the modules work or what's inside, the only important thing is knowing which operation it performs and the inputs and outputs it has. This would allow us to build bigger circuits with different modules that could carry out more complex operations.",

We are creating a 2 to 4 decoder, which takes two binary inputs to activate one of four outputs.  Each output corresponds to a specific combination of the inputs.  With the presence of lactose and arabinose, our Bacterial Decoder will express Green Fluorescent Protein.  If only lactose is present, a different fluorescent protein will be expressed.  This goes for the other two combinations as well (only arabinose, or neither sugars).  To implement logic we use combinations of small non-coding RNAs and transcription factors.  The system allows the next engineer to swap standard parts in and out to change the inputs and outputs.  Our Bacterial Decoder can help sense for multiple environmental cues, having implications for medical diagnostics and environmental and water contaminant detection.",

The protocol relies on the 'Best Match' method developed in response to the limitations of other screening protocols previously proposed by trade organizations. The objective of the 'Best Match' method is to identify sequences which are uniquely related to Select Agents or Toxins. The GenoTHREAT software is being developed in accordance with the Government guidance and, to our knowledge, is the first implementation of the sequence screening procedure outlined in the guidance.

        "abstract": "Photoreceptors are ubiquitous proteins that allow an organism to sense light. These proteins have evolved in unique environments to sense light intensity in different colour ranges. This experiment focuses on constructing a biological switch that uses two photoreceptors from separate organisms -- Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumafaciens. The coupling of heme oxygenase supplies our photoreceptor proteins with biliverdin, allowing for the self-assembly of the switch within host systems. The switch is the first stage of a two component light sensor and when expressed at high level, there is a noticeable colour change of the cell when it is activated by light.",

These properties stem from the relationships between the chemical nature of the sugars, their arrangement within the polymer and the arrangement of the polymer itself. Scientists rely on chemical modification of polysaccharides or expensive and time-consuming production via synthetic chemistry to understand these relationships.\r\n\r\nThis project, e-candi, asks if synthetic biology could generate designer polysaccharides.\r\n\r\nWe created biobricks for the biosynthesis of useful polysaccharides in Escherichia coli and asked whether we could synthesise a novel polymer sequence in E. coli by targeting endogenous polysaccharide biosynthesis.\r\n\r\nWe developed this work further through the generation of a GTase database with a user-friendly interface to aid polymer construction, and by investigating a GTase donor/acceptor characterization assay alongside mathematical modeling of our biosynthetic system in order to improve system understanding and performance.",

To demonstrate the potential of a \"smart\" strategy, we are developing a \"Trojan Horse\" type of approach based on bactriophage-lambda.\r\nOur project uses phage lambda and its target organism, E.coli, as a proof of concept for creating a system with predefined actions that demonstrates the described strategy. The design is based on a high specificity system which combines several different cell elements that will function as a type of logic AND gate. The phage will not harm the bacteria unless three independent conditions are met, activating the phage's lytic cycle and resulting in the bacteria's death; imitating a \"Trojan Horse\".",

Our group endeavored to develop S. elongatus as an emergent platform for synthetic biology and metabolic engineering.While Synechococcus elongatus has been used in previous synthetic biology projects, our group sought not only to characterize functional promoters, but also promoters capable of tailoring expression to circadian rhythms or transcriptional factors. Concurrently, our team experimented with fluorescent proteins to find a quick-folding, robust, and transient reporter that may be used to characterize dynamic parts (such as those involved in circadian rhythms).As proof of concept, the VCU iGEM team also aspired to integrate isoprenoid pathways into Synechococcus - isoprenoids being precursors of many commercially and pharmaceutically relevant molecules. By demonstrating production of these industrially important metabolites we hope to show the practicality of utilizing cyanobacteria as a superior sustainable production platform. \"",

It is known that for instance neurons, cardiomyocites or muscle cells are able to sense and respond to electrical signals. These cells use a common second messenger system, calcium ion, which promotes a defined response when an electrical pulse is supplied to them. Nevertheless, these cultures present several technical disadvantages in order to make a handily use of them. Valencia team uses this property on yeast to produce luminescence as a response to electrical stimulus. This project constitutes the first time in which the electrical response of Saccharomyces and its potential applications are going to be tested. The obtained results will be used to build the first iLCD in history. We will reflect the perception that different groups of people have about Synthetic Biology in the survey http://igemvalencia.questionpro.com.",

Our first project aims to improve the economics of algal biofuel production by creating a cost efficient microalgae bioflocculant out of E. coli. To achieve this, we over-express Type I pili to increase the cell's adhesiveness, and also express a chlorovirus protein on the cell surface which specifically binds Chlorella species, a promising algal feedstock for the biofuel industry. We are also participating in the Oil Sands Initiative and seeking to improve the biodegradation rate of naphthenic acids (NAs), a toxic by-product of the oil extraction process which can linger in the environment for decades. Two Pseudomonas strains have been found to synergistically degrade 95% of NAs. Our project focuses on engineering these Pseudomonas strains to form biofilms in the harsh tailings water environment, which can potentially increase degradation rates by two orders of magnitude, by expressing a self-associating E. coli protein.",

We are working on a field bioassay based on fluorescent proteins that will indicate the presence of naphthalene in a soil sample. The goal is to have a population of green fluorescent worms chemotaxing toward and a population of red fluorescent worms chemotaxing away from the napthalene in the soil sample. Finally, we have biobricked the P. putida gene nahD, which encodes a degradative enzyme as part of a naphthalene catabolic pathway. The nahD gene encodes the enzyme 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid isomerase, which catalyzes the fourth step in the catabolic pathway. \"",

Another bacteria strain expressing the protease would wait on the finish line to cut off target protein.Besides loading and unloading, we took advantage of 'tar' and 'tar*' receptor to manipulate E.

Multiplex Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE), an alternative technique for rapidly generating genomic diversity using the recombination ability of the λ-phage ssDNA-binding protein β, has to date only been introduced in E. coli. These cells must be transformed via electroporation for each MAGE cycle to facilitate efficient uptake of mutagenic oligonucleotides, but this process kills a significant portion of otherwise viable cells. For our project, we designed and created a universal test cassette system to introduce MAGE to diverse bacteria as well as a library of β homologs for testing. Finally, we optimized the technique for the naturally competent organisms B. subtilis and A. baylyi to eliminate the costly electroporation step and developed computational algorithms to aid in the design and prediction of MAGE experiments.",

To progress, researchers must often determine the mating type of haploid strains, which typically takes days. The goal of our project is to reduce that time to hours. So we designed a novel promoter harboring Ste12 and LexA binding sequences and placed it upstream of an ORF encoding a red fluorescent reporter fused to LexA binding and VP64 activator domains. Others have shown that this fusion protein induces its own expression from a LexA promoter. We propose that Ste12, activated in the pheromone response pathway, will bind the hybrid promoter and induce expression of the fusion protein, which will amplify and maintain its own expression. Therefore, when mating pheromone receptors on a haploid harboring this latch-type circuit are bound and activated, the cell will fluoresce and function as a rapid mating type detector.",

By using directed evolution, we aim to modulate the receptor binding domain to enable the interaction with similar phenolic substances like capsaicin. Brought into E. coli, this modulated system will induce light effects of different intensities - depending on the concentration of capsaicin respectively the spiciness of the sample. The capsaicin detection is a proof of principle concept. We aim to establish a system, which is characterized by a high sensitivity and specifity and is capable to replace slow and high priced diagnostics or analytic methods.

The timer function is controlled by Lac promoter, and the concentration of lactose determines timer’s working length. After added lactose is consumed by E. coli, the RFP will be translated to remind us that time’s up. The counter function can detect the bacteria population with LuxI/LuxR device; moreover, the counter sensitivity is controlled by the strength of TetR repressible promoter. If external bacteria invade the system, the extra AHL produced by them will induce the RFP translation to warn us the contamination. Our project can be applied to storage warning signs of fresh food, contact lens, and wound dressing.",

In this project, the concept of a whole-cell biosensor has been adapted for medical use as a diagnostic for viral infection through engineering a commensal bacterium. Lactobacilli are the predominant commensal organisms in the human vaginal mucosa and are ideally placed to detect the presence of a sexually transmitted infection, such as Human Papillomavirus. A strain of this bacterium has been modified to produce a chromogenic reporter, which is visible to the naked eye, when 'switched on' through exposure to the input signal (viral infection). However, in order for this to be clearly visible in vivo, this signal needs to be transmitted throughout the entire bacterial population. Thus, this project focused on a) modifying a Gram-positive bacterium to produce the chromogenic reporter; b) using a heterologous quorum-sensing mechanism to propagate an auto-regulated feedback loop amongst a bacterial population.",

We are putting the rEV131 gene into an endogenous element of human nasal flora, Staphylococcus epidermidis. rEV131 will have a secretion tag specific for S. epidermidis. To synchronize rEV131 production with elevation of histamine concentration, we are computationally designing a novel histamine receptor. This histamine-responsive receptor will induce expression of rEV131. Although S. epidermidis is a non-pathogenic species, when it reaches a certain population threshold it produces potentially hazardous biofilms. To mitigate this concern, we have engineered safety measures that prevent excessive growth by repurposing S. epidmidis’ natural population sensor to cue each cell’s \"suicide\" when a population has reached a dangerous size.",

Inspired by an article by Kim et al on bacterial carpets that could generate flow, we have designed a biological system in E. coli that can induce flow and increase mixing in a fluid, essentially working as a microscopic flow actuator. The actuator uses E. coli's flagellas and can be switched on and off using light. Our system is composed of several novel parts: a photosensor, that controls the tumbling frequency of E. coli's flagella via chemical pathways; a hyperflagellation part, to increase the number of flagella and the power of the system; a retinal producing part, that works with the 2009 Cambridge's iGEM team's _-Carotene brick, which we have helped further characterize.  Our human practices focused on watermarking synthetic genetic material and improve security in synthetic biology.",

By replacing the periplasmic domain of ToxR with existing or engineered ligand-dependent homodimers, we hope to link ToxR dimerization (and gene expression) to the presence of specific ligands. Initially, ToxR constructs proved to be toxic to E. coli. To address ToxR toxicity, we screened microarray data for promoters that exhibited stress-based down regulation. We constructed a negative feedback system with the rffGH promoter, which permits the use of potentially toxic proteins like our various ToxR chimeras. By fusing existing or engineered ligand dependent homodimers to ToxR, this modular system can be applied to develop new biosensors. \"",

Typically, the production of biopharmaceuticals is triggered by the addition of an induction agent, often IPTG, during the bioprocess. The UCL iGEM team aims to create 'independent' cells in which the production phase is triggered by an external stimulus, removing the need for IPTG.  The stationary phase growth in bioreactors is preceded by a dip in dissolved oxygen tension (DOT) followed by a DOT spike. We have developed a genetic circuit in which a series of promoters will cause the production to be triggered by the hypoxic condition. This auto-induction promises an economically and manufacturing improved production of biopharmaceuticals. There is the potential of applying this 'Pavlovian' circuit principle in near future to yeast, mammalian or other expression systems for the production of complex biomolecules for the treatment of major diseases.",

Our Flower Fairy E.coli are capable of blooming flowers on demand by producing FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) protein, called Florigen, a kind of plant hormone composed of 175 amino acids.  To make it possible for FT protein to access to plant cells directly from E.coli, we established a new protein translocation system, R-TAT.  Our R-TAT system can carry proteins from the cytoplasm to plant cells while maintaining appropriate folding of target proteins.　We will show that FT protein induces expression of genes involved in anthesis and functions effectively at low doses by confirming that FT protein activates some key blooming-related genes such as AP1.　We will also provide iGEMers incredible promoters constructed through Golden Gate Assembly. Our Giant Controllable-Promoter, for example, is composed of 5x promoter regions following a Lac repressor element.",

        "abstract": "Many synthetic biology projects propose the application of Genetically Engineered Organisms (GEOs) in natural environments. However, issues of biosafety and ethics constrain the use of GEOs outside the lab. A primary concern is the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) of synthetic genes to natural populations. Strategies developed to address this problem provide varying levels of containment, however, the substantial elimination of HGT remains difficult or perhaps impossible.\r\n\r\nWe have developed a new containment system to expand the range of environments where GEOs can be used safely. To do so, we rely on three levels of containment: physical containment with alginate capsules, semantic containment using an amber suppressor system, and an improved killswitch featuring delayed population-level suicide through complete genome degradation. We aim to raise the issue of biosafety by engaging the general public and scientific community through debate, and to advocate the discerning use of biosafety circuits in future iGEM projects.",

We will also attempt to use our approach to create a novel chemical product of the existing biosynthetic reactions.

We aim to develop micro-machines that can stop and even reverse desertification by recovering vegetation in these areas. We envison a 'Continuous Greening Cycle' in which engineered microorganisms decompose plant fibers into nutrients through the action of cellulolytic enzymes. They then produce water-absorbant polymers such as poly(gamma-glutamic) acid that retain water in the soil to help plants grow. When the plants die they will be decomposed to start the cycle anew. In addition to aiming for the continuous and self-expanding greening of desert areas, we hope to contribute to iGEM by developing useful BioBricks!",

However, preventing or curing these diseases is presently of extreme difficulty. Our team, Todai-Tokyo, has been tackling treatment of lifestyle diseases such as hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, circadian rhythm dysfunction, and bad smoking habits by using synthetic living systems, utilizing their ability to incorporate complex logic functions and dispensability of external control once in operation. To do this, we aim to create the following:  cells that ingest cholesterol to decrease blood cholesterol levels, healthy low calorie breads, a system in which periodic gene expression is controlled, and bacteria that encourage smokers to quit smoking, respectively. By applying similar synthetic biology  methodologies to these, prevention of numerous lifestyle-related diseases may become reality, serving as a first step towards their eradication.",

Where attempts at physical removal and biodegradable plastics have failed to solve this pollution disaster, synthetic biology steps in. UCL’s project proposes the bioremediation of microplastic waste by two systems: degradation using a laccase enzyme or aggregation by controlled expression of curli. Ultimately we envisage the construction of habitable islands - turning waste into a resource. We used novel chassis: two marine bacteria, Oceanibulbus indoliflex  and Roseobacter denitrificans. In line with considering the viability of our project, we questioned the access ordinary citizens should have to these tools. Initiating a new partnership, UCL teamed up with a group of ‘biohackers’ (citizen scientists in molecular biology) to create the world’s first ‘Public BioBrick’.",

The project is focused in two essential conditions on this process: Increase the planet temperature, resistance of microorganism to thermal changes. The proposal is that dark yeast cells retain the arriving radiation and heat the surface. But, once the temperature reaches its optimum on the planetary surface the color production should be switched off. In order to achieve that and taking advantage of Synthetic Biology principles, a switch based on prion proteins (on mad yeast!) will be used. The work will be complemented with the implementation of the expression of  LEA (late embryogenesis abundant) 'antifreeze' protein. Summarizing, we are going to build a engineered yeast resistant to temperature changes and able to produce a dark pigment which will be the responsible of a global temperature increase on Mars.",

Originally derived from Xanthomonas spp., this type of protein comprizes an effector domain and a modular DNA binding domain that can be rationally designed to bind to virtually any target sequence of DNA. Over the past two years, universal endonucleases (TALENs) and transcription factors have been tested in various organisms ranging from bacteria to humans.\r\nAccording to existing protocols, TALE assembly requires several weeks of work and substantial lab skills. In order to bring this technology within reach for iGEM students, we invented an extremely fast and easy TALE assembly strategy and developed a TALE platform with expression plasmids and new classes of TALEs.\r\nWith our so called GATE assembly kit, future iGEM students will be able to precisely manipulate genomic loci easier and faster than anyone else in the world.",

Our endeavor as “outsiders” is to bring our training in the arts and design to synthetic biology. Over this summer, we learnt the tools and techniques of synthetic biology and developed a piece of life which reflects our concerns, namely, the cultural, ethical and aesthetic implications of Synthetic Biology. Using a DIY approach and getting our hands “wet” was a critical element in the learning process.  Our construct synthesizes Geosmin, an enzyme normally produced by cyanobacteria and actinobacteria. The biosynthesis of geosmin from farnesyl diphosphate is catalyzed by a single enzyme germacradienol/germacrene D synthase.E. coli, does not bear a gene that codes for this enzyme. We have expressed this gene in different strains of  E. coli. Geosmin is responsible for producing the earthy smell when rain falls after a dry spell of weather.",

By utilising elements of this pathway, with a novel recovery mechanism, mercury can be accumulated intracellularly and efficiently removed from the environment. The presence of mercury activates MerR, driving the expression of Antigen 43 (Ag43), a self-adhering surface protein. Coupling a mercury sensitive promoter to the expression of Ag43 enables cells to accumulate mercury then aggregate in solution. P. syringae is a ubiquitous airborne bacterium which expresses a unique protein, InaZ. This protein acts as a scaffold for ice nucleation, inducing precipitation. Optimal growth of P. syringae occurs at 22oC. By introducing five heat-shock genes, the tolerance range will be increased to better suit the Australian climate.  This modification has the potential to increase the availability of Australia’s most precious resource; water.",

We aim to solve this issue by contributing a library of well-characterized yeast toggle switch components with varying dynamics. In order to characterize these switches, each of the two repressors, driven by mutually repressible promoters, is tagged with a distinct fluorescent protein that can be detected and quantified using flow cytometry. To expand the BioBrick database we will submit functionally-tested yeast-enhanced fluorescent proteins, repressors, and a library of repressible promoters. Furthermore, to demonstrate the applicability of these components in fine tuning genetic networks, we hope to use these toggle switches to build a DNA damage sensor with varying levels of sensitivity. We also describe novel methods for BioBrick construction based on natural homologous recombination mechanisms in S. cerevisiae.",

        "abstract": "Iron deficiency affects 2 billion people - or over 30% of the world’s population – and can lead to anemia, ill health, and even death. Surprisingly, this deficiency is typically not due to a lack of dietary iron, but rather due to low bio-availability, and thus poor absorption of iron. Phytic acid is a prevalent chelator of iron and other nutrients in food. Our mission is to build a system that breaks down phytic acid in the digestive system, releasing bound iron for the body to absorb. Our solution comprises two engineered components: a module that constitutively produces phytase to break down phytic acid and a pH-sensitive module that causes cells to lyse and release the accumulated phytase in the stomach. If successful, our strain would be a low-cost sustainable solution to preventing iron deficiency without the need for constant supplies of iron supplements.",

A putative advantage a probiotic treatment over direct enzyme therapy approaches is the potential for administering fewer doses, thus making it less troublesome, less costly, and more convenient.  Our secretion system consists of an inducible promoter, ribosome binding site, an extracellular anchor (ompA/INPNC), cleavage signal sequence, 6 HIS Tag and a terminator.  We have tested its behavior in E. coli on two proteins of varying sizes (GFP/Luciferase).",

Production of these intermediates is currently triggered by inefficient methods, such as chemical inputs (tetracycline, estrogen-analogs, arabinose, etc) or drastic changes to the cellular environment (pH, oxygen levels, temperature, etc). On an industrial scale, this chemical induction requires large quantities of reagents and extensive purification, while environmental induction requires conditions that can adversely affect cell vitality and yield. To this end, we have designed an E. coli genetic circuit that can pass through four stable states of protein production triggered solely by ON/OFF patterns of light. To efficiently test the components of our circuit, we have also created a system for the transient delivery of transcription factors through the cell and nuclear membranes. With this production method, we can link multiple synthesis steps to a single, clean and rapidly scalable input.",

Large scale (150mg/L), stable production of RiAFP and a RiAFP-GFP fusion protein was achieved in E. coli. Proteins were purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. E. coli expressing RiAFP exhibited increased survival post-freezing. RiAFP inhibited ice recrystallization in both splat and capillary assay. To optimize the activity of the hypothesized RiAFP ice binding site, we are using directed evolution through multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE). Finally, we are further optimizinge our crystallization conditions for RiAFP to better understand the structure-function relationship, as well as conducting post-freezing survival assays in C. elegans.\"",

NAs are toxic surfactants released into tailings ponds as a by-product of the bitumen extraction process of oil sands.  Microorganisms indigenous to tailings ponds that are uniquely capable of degrading NAs suggest that bioremediation may be a viable solution.  To be successful, however, levels of NAs need to be monitored and existing methods for detection are costly and offsite.  Using two NA-degrading organisms relatively new to iGEM: microalgae and pseudomonads, we used bioinformatics and a novel NA affinity-based screen in an attempt to identify a sensory element.  In the process, we have characterized an electrochemical reporter system and built a working measurement device.  We have also submitted new parts for future work in microalgae, as well as novel parts to move constructs between Pseudomonas and E. coli.\"",

Taking genes from fireflies and Vibrio fischeri, the Cambridge team have constructed BioBricks which allow light output at a wide range of wavelengths.  Firefly luciferase is already used as a reporter, but requires continual addition of the expensive substrate luciferin.  We have created codon-optimised operons combining luciferase with a luciferin regenerating enzyme (LRE).  This allows recycling of luciferin for sustained light output. In addition, we have submitted the first lux operon to the registry, taking genes from bacteria which form symbiotic relationships with squid.  This is the first BioBrick to emit light without addition of substrate and can be used as a reporter with any promoter. These two approaches will allow cheaper assays with brighter signals.  We also hope they will lay the foundations for natural light sources that help to address the energy crisis facing our planet.",

While rice can be fortified using vitamin powders, such approaches have had limited success because many vitamins are leeched away during the washing process prior to cooking. To address this problem, we have engineered proteins that will adhere nutrients to rice grains and prevent losses. These proteins contain a starch-binding domain that is fused to specific nutrient-binding domains. Because rice is composed mainly of starch, the starch-binding domain prevents nutrient leeching during washing. Upon cooking, the nutrient-binding domain denatures and releases the nutrients into the cooked rice. Supplementing rice with these fusion proteins will provide a novel, non-GMO approach to fortifying rice. Proteins with a starch-binding domain connected to a vitamin B12-binding domain, a thiamine-binding domain, a lysine-rich protein, and a RFP have been created.",

There are over 200 possible PCBs, derivatives of biphenyl, which share the same biodegradation pathways in bacteria. Our team is using a genetic engineering approach to produce a small consortium of E. coli that should efficiently degrade biphenyl, and it is hoped that this same system can be adapted for the bioremediation of PCBs. Natural bioremediation by native bacterial communities is exceedingly slow due to the recalcitrant nature of PCBs and their hydrophobic properties which reduce the bioavailability to potential catabolizers. We are taking a three-pronged approach in an attempt to increase the efficiency of biphenyl bioremediation—attraction of biphenyl-degrading E. coli by other guiding bacteria, overexpression of the biphenyl catabolic enzymes, and production of a biosurfactant to increase the solubility of biphenyl. Together, this system should significantly increase the rate of biphenyl degradation.",

Metabolism of certain organic compounds is sometimes limited by the production of toxic intermediates. Several bacteria have evolved protein based microcompartments capable of sequestering such reactions, thus protecting cytosolic machinery and processes from interference by these intermediates. For our project, we will identify and transform the genes encoding proteins responsible for the production and assembly of bacterial microcompartment. Additionally, we will confirm the signal sequences that target enzymes to the protein compartments by fusing this sequence to reporter genes. To demonstrate the microcompartment's potential to serve as nanobioreactors, we will target genes encoding a short catabolic pathway into recombinant microcompartments assembled in E. coli.",

Here, we use Zinc Fingers as transcriptional repressors in a newly designed interfacing network, the controller, for a modified version of the original toggle switch. The controller interface is made with emphasis on interoperability and applications in mind. Specifically, we use zinc finger repressors and degradation tags to reduce cross-talk and make the network more robust. Nine ZF transcription factors are computationally characterized and submitted to the registry.

Acetaldehyde is a toxic and carcinogenic component of cigarette smoke. It has a boiling point of 20.2C and is very volatile, thus can be used as an information carrier through air. The SmoColi cells are immobilized in an agarose-filled microfluidic device. The test solution is fed on one end of a microfluidic channel, in which an acetaldehyde gradient is established by synthetic cellular degradation. The cells are engineered to sense acetaldehyde by a synthetically re-designed fungal acetaldehyde-responsive transactivator. The sensor is linked to a band-pass filter that drives GFP expression. This allows establishment of an input-concentration-dependent, spatially located fluorescent band displaying quantitative information about acetaldehyde. Finally, if the acetaldehyde concentration exceeds the threshold of malignance, a quorum-sensing-based mCherry alarm system springs into action, turning the whole device red.",

Our E. chiver system adds several elements yielding new applications.  Our team designed two E. chiver constructs utilizing Lambda and P21 machinery.  Each can in theory be used to shuttle a plasmid construct between two forms:  a single chromosomal insert and a high copy number plasmid.   In their current designs the systems must function separately, but possible routes have been identified by our team to make the co-functioning of these systems possible.  We can see elements of our project being used in drug delivery systems as a method to keep a gene of interest dormant unless in the correct condition/location, and with further exploration into the co-functioning routes it may be used to create a 'bacterial filing cabinet'.\"",

We have sought to engineer a bacterium able to detect TNT and its degradation products, nitrites, in the environment. Our system is based around a previously published computationally designed TNT-sensing protein derived from the periplasmic ribose binding protein, which interacts with an EnvZ-Trg transmembrane hybrid fusion protein and a nitrite-responsive repressor to trigger a pathway of TNT degradation and visualization using combined output from a bacterial luciferase and Yellow Fluorescent Protein. We envisage that the detection system could be applied by spraying the organism on soil where the presence of landmines is suspected, and detecting luminescence using low-light sensing. Once located, the mines could be safely removed. This system could be extended to detect other analytes in the environment.",

Most chemical  coatings used presently are costly or harmful to the environment. Our idea is to engineer Bacillus subtilis which when applied to a surface, automatically forms a hydrophobic biofilm coating. Succesful biofilm formation will serve as a trigger for the expression of hydrophobic proteins called Chaplins. The result of this process will be a rigid biofilm with embedded hydrophobic proteins, leaving a coated surface which is extremely hydrophobic. Producing a self-assembling hydrophobic biofilm is cheap, there is no high-tech treatment involved and there are no hazardous chemicals necessary to attain a hydrophobic coating. Applications of this hydrophobic biofilm range from anti-fouling coatings on ships to anti-corrosion coatings used to protect sensory equipment.",

However, many important biological processes are governed by the ratio between the concentrations of multiple chemicals. To create systems capable of responding to more complex input data, the Stanford team designed two types of ratio-measuring sensors. The first sensor utilizes two unique small RNAs to inhibit the transcription of two operons, each responding to an environmental factor and having a specific flourescent protein (or output gene). By manipulating the number of small RNAs produced, a tipping point between outputs can be established for different input ratios. The second sensor uses a phosphorylatable protein to control the transcription rate of an output promoter. By linearly associating two chemical inputs to the production of a kinase and a phosphatase, the ratio of the two environmental factors indirectly dictates the activity of the output promoter.",

        "abstract": "The project aims to realize a device with standard biological parts for the post-transcriptional control of gene expression, regardless of the gene sequence to be silenced. We designed the T-REX device, composed of two non-coding DNA sequences: the TRANS-repressor and the CIS-repressing parts. TRANS-repressor acts as a silencer of CIS-repressing RNA target. This target includes a region complementary to the TRANS-repressor sequence antisense, ends with RBS, and is assembled upstream of the coding sequence to be silenced. Upon binding of TRANS-repressor and CIS-repressing RNAs, the access to RBS by ribosomes is hampered, silencing translation. Accordingly, the amount of TRANS-repressor controls the translation rate of the regulated gene. The TRANS-repressor sequence was determined by a computational analysis performed to minimize the interference with the genomic mRNAs and to maximize the base-pairing interaction to the CIS-repressing RNA.  The T-REX device is proposed as a universal and fast switch in synthetic gene circuits.",

Even if  whey can be valorized by extracting high value substances, like whey-proteins, at the end of the treatment the residual liquid is still a special waste for its high lactose content (4%). E. coli was engineered to convert efficiently lactose into ethanol, a precious biofuel. Three main enzymes are involved in this transformation: beta-galactosidase, pyruvate-decarboxylase and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII. Beta-galactosidase (lacZ gene) was over-expressed to obtain higher lactose-glucose conversion yield. Coding sequences  of pyruvate-decarboxylase (pdc) and alcohol-dehydrogenaseII (adhB), essential in alcoholic fermentation pathway, were designed by DNA chemical synthesis and codon-optimized for E. coli. The final circuit includes the device to metabolize lactose and the ethanol-producing operon, containing pdc and adhB. It has a theoretical yield of 20kilos/tons of whey. Finally, 3OC6HSL, aTc and lactose/IPTG inducible systems were characterized to be used in this circuit.",

We proposed two synthetic-biological approaches to OA, one with a eukaryotic genetic circuit and another prokaryotic. Both circuits are composed of three systems: 'Detector', 'Actuator' and 'Supervisor'. As for Detector, we built tissue-specific promoters in the eukaryotic circuit, while inflammation factors are employed as signals of OA in the prokaryotic circuit. The same Actuator shared by two circuits generates proteins col2a1, which replenishes the degraded matrix, and oct4, which reverses the disordered differentiation. The eukaryotic Supervisor part has an original design in which a photo-sensitive cation channel crosstalks with certain cellular signaling pathways, resulting in the light-controlled expression of col2a1 and oct4; in the counterpart of prokaryotic circuit, both injected inducers and over-population lead the engineered bacteria to suicide, thus attenuating possible side effects.",

These sensors are to be activated both independently and together. This functions as a triple-switch of genetic regulation. In combination of switching the individual sensors on-and-off, one can achieve higher dimensions of transcriptional control. The proof of concept is shown by coupling each type of sensor with chromoproteins, proteins that naturally show color when expressed.Instead of visualization by e.g. UV light, our colidroid system can be visualized with naked eye. Other than a bacterial piece of art, our system will be very useful in the future concerning e.g. biomaterial. \"",

Potentially, these could be engineered to house any chemical reaction imaginable; to sequester toxic material; or to confer new physical properties to a host. Here, a synthetic microcompartment ('The Sphereactor') was designed and built. This was assisted by the creation of new mobile apps and web-based tools for DNA analysis. A synthetic operon was constructed, based on the pduABJKNTU genes from Salmonella, that assembled into the empty Sphereactor, which was also affinity-tagged to allow its isolation for downstream applications. A new targeting sequence comprising 20 residues of PduD was shown to target GFP into The Sphereactor. Attempts were made to pack the Sphereactor with many other proteins. Together, the Sphereactor and its new targeting sequence is a foundational advance that could influence the design of new metabolic pathways or inspire new bioremediation or biomedical projects.",

We established a novel streamlined workflow for obtaining antibodies by incorporating all natural steps such as antibody maturation, selection and production in one genetic system implemented into a eukaryotic cell line. We stably transfect an antibody construct into CHO cells and mimic maturation by using the enzyme AID (activation-induced deaminase), which is known to induce somatic hypermutation. For selection, we are testing and deploying a versatile and continuous viral system as well as magnetic beads and cell sorting. Finally, a genetic switch enables the transition from surface expression to production of soluble antibodies. In addition, we pursue phage display with an antibody fragment to study mutation rate and evolution by AID in prokaryotes. Our system supersedes animal immunization, and the smooth process will increase the ready availability of antibodies in various formats.",

It can pass a whole protein molecule from a bacterial cell to a target eukaryotic cell. This apparatus which looks like a syringe is an organelle of pathogenic gram-negative bacterium such as Salmonella and Yersinia. We are aiming at making this device available for E. coli. Because it will not involve usage of pathogenic strains, it will be safer to use.  To transfer T3SS functionally from Salmonella to E.coli it is essential to integrate at least 40kb of DNA fragment coding more than 20 proteins. So we will make suggestions about how to optimize E.coli transformation method for large size DNA fragments. Also we will show how to construct protein for secretion and how to measure if it is really secreted using GFP.",

We believe that we can use related design principles to synthesize spatial patterning in bacterial populations.  Previous genetic devices have allowed bacterial lawns to faithfully reproduce spatial patterns and, with the inclusion of of cell-cell communication, to construct of a bacterial edge detection device.  Our device builds on these ideas but differs significantly by aspiring to produce complex spatial patterns in response to simple stimuli rather than by copying the input stimulus.  This genetic circuit could drive the creation of biological systems capable of generating spatially varying gene expression profiles in response to simple chemical stimuli.  Such devices should have application in fields such as nanofabrication, environmental engineering and tissue engineering.",

        "abstract": "Lacking a genetically strict sex determination system, fish are very sensitive to hormonally active agents in water. The extensive use of fertilizers and the inability of sewage treatment plants to break down drug waste lead to increasingly high concentrations of so-called endocrine disruptors in rivers. As a result, male fish have been found to be less fertile and even develop female sex tissue, so called ovotesties. Since fish spawn is constantly exposed to river waters, fish development is easily disturbed, and while the ratio of female fish increases, population numbers decrease. For sensing we use a membrane-bound receptor of Danio rerio. Activation will lead to bioluminescence which can be read out by photometric measurement.",

The first bacterial reporters appeared 20 years ago, although these early tests didn't use genetically modified microorganisms. Further research and development in the area of genetic engineering has resulted in newer and more sophisticated bacterial sensors, capable of detecting the presence of contaminants, sugars and amino acids in different media such as soil and water. However, most bacterial sensors can only detect the presence of a compound at a certain concentration and currently there are few documented bacterial sensors that can detect and report different concentrations of the compound of interest. Our objective was to develop a genetic frame, compatible with the BioBrick standard, for the creation of a concentration-sensitive bacterial sensor. In the process we also developed and characterized BioBricks for two new families of phage activators.",

One such application could be the optimization and fine-tuning of synthetic biological circuits, which is currently a cumbersome process of trial and error. We have investigated a novel type of RNA regulation, where the inhibition caused by a small regulatory RNA is relieved by another RNA called trap-RNA. The system displays a large dynamic range and can uniquely target and repress any gene of interest providing unprecedented flexibility. We suspect that any level of repression is achievable by simply altering the sequences of the involved RNAs. Multiple such systems can coexist without interfering and are thus compatible with more complex designs. Furthermore the trap-RNA can be fused to any transcript in effect allowing any gene to act as an activator.\"",

Protegrin-1â€™s secondary structure is a beta -sheet conformation including a b-hairpin turn, which allows it to imbed itself into the phospholipid bilayer and disrupt bacterial cell walls by creating pores within the membrane.The antimicrobial activity of protegrin-1, including the action of pore formation, provides us with a wealth of potential applications for this kill switch, including drug delivery, conjugation both in vivo and in vitro, and its use as a basic biosafety tool.",

It is possible through recombinant DNA technology to isolate this promoter and combine it to a reporter system and transform bacteria to create a biosensor for arsenic. Induction of the arsenic-sensitive promoter occurs by the binding of arsenite to an inhibitory protein, de-repressing transcription.  We have observed the arsenic responsive promoter from E. coli to have a consistent, low level of background induction.  We have tested the hypothesis that by increasing the quantity of the inhibitory protein in the cell, we can quantifiably raise the threshold of the response.

Thanks to synthetic biology applications exploiting the yeast chassis, valuable compounds such as anti-malarial drugs and specialty chemicals can now be produced inexpensively. Using Golden Gate assembly designed for BioBrick compatibility, we have developed two tools to improve yeast expression of non-native pathways. First, we engineered an ethanol control system that reduces yeast's endogenous stress response and diverts more cellular resources towards product synthesis. Second, we constructed a light-induced system for instantaneous gain- and loss-of-function at the protein level. These tools will allow engineers to optimize heterologous pathways by monitoring toxic intermediates or regulating flux in a controllable, time-dependent manner. We hope our ideas will shape the future of industrial cell-based manufacturing.",

        "abstract": "Increasing levels of fertilizer required for mechanized farming can result in elevated nitrate levels in soil and groundwater. Due to contaminated food and water, humans are at risk for Methemoglobinemia caused by enterohepatic metabolism of nitrates into ammonia. This process also oxidizes the iron in hemoglobin, rendering it unable to carry oxygen. Infants in particular are susceptible to Methemoglobinemia, also known as “Blue Baby Syndrome”, when formula is reconstituted using contaminated water. In order to prevent Methemoglobinemia, it is essential to detect high concentrations of nitrates. Fnr-NarG is an aerobic mutation of the nitrogen-sensitive promoter NarG that was provided by Dr. Lindow at UC Berkeley. By combining Red Fluorescent Protein with an aerobic mutant strain of NarG, the creation of Red Fluorescent Nitrate Detector (RFND) is possible. RFND is economically efficient because of its ability to self-replicate.",

Our aim is to confer resistance to cholera by taking advantage of quorum-sensing regulated pathogenicity. CAI-1, the cholera autoinducer, is produced by the enzyme, CqsA. E. coli engineered to express CqsA could grow along with regular gut flora and render V. cholerae avirulent by maintaining high CAI-1 concentrations. To lessen its metabolic burden, the system should respond to low concentrations of autoinducer produced by V. cholerae and co-ordinate this response using the Lux quorum-sensing system. We have explored rearranging the network architecture of the Lux system to give bistable expression. A model to describe bistability was formed using ODEs and implemented in C++. To assess the perception of synthetic biology, software was written to gather data from social networking and news sites and quantify the change in opinions with time.",

For controlling cell death, we designed 'Lysisbox' consists of a pair of modules: 'Killer gene' and 'Anti-killer gene.' As the Killer gene for E.coli, we noted the lysis cassette [SRRz/Rz1gene] of lambda phage coding for a holin and an endolysin. The holin forms pores in the inner membrane, and the endolysin access to and degrade the peptidoglycan by passing through the pores, leading the E.coli to death. As the Anti-killer gene, we chose S-TMD1 coding for a dominant-negative holin that inhibits the formation of the fatal pores. The balance of these two genes expression level has a key of the E.Coli's life or death. In addition, such controllable membrane pores must show critical functions for all living organisms with lipid membranes. 'Lysisbox' will contribute a lot to future projects, thus you must say 'FANTASTIC!!!'",

These easy to culture and robust organisms are also a desirable eukaryotic chassis for synthetic biology, but there are few tools for delivering biomolecules into these organisms. So, we engineered E. coli to deliver proteins and/or DNA payloads into these bacteria-devouring eukaryotes. Once ingested, our E. coli are programmed to self-lyse and porate the phagosome, releasing their payloads into the cytosol. This delivery mechanism has the potential to deliver payload to any phagocytic organism with a cholesterol-based membrane. As part of our parallel software effort to rework the Clotho plugin environment and API, we made automatic biosafety handling an intrinsic feature of the core. Together, these tools provide a foundation for metazoan synthetic biology and a framework for improving safety in our field.",

A common challenge when using non-native genes in metabolic engineering is determining if they are being properly expressed. To address this issue, we have constructed a BioFusion compatible system for testing the translation of a gene of interest. This system couples the translation of the target gene to a fluorescent reporter gene. Fluorescence will only be detected when the target gene is entirely translated. This construct enables synthetic biologists to quickly determine if a gene is being expressed without the need for costly antibodies or analytical instruments (e.g. mass spectrometry). Currently, we are utilizing this cassette to troubleshoot the expression of limonene synthase, an enzyme that catalyzes the production of limonene, a monoterpene with potential as a renewable jet fuel.",

Our lab has developed and characterised a cheap, versatile soil fertility sensor based on an E.coli chassis. It expresses fluorescent signals upon nutrient detection, producing a high-resolution nutrient distribution map of arable land. The ratio of two fluorescent signals allows farmers to quantify soil nutrient content. agrEcoli bacteria, encapsulated within a gel container to improve visibility and prevent escape, have been shown to work on soil in lab conditions. We have explored the marketing of our device, considering public perceptions of synthetic biology. BSim, our prize-winning modelling framework, has been extended to analyse our new biobrick's behaviour within gel capsules. In addition, a new interface for BSim has improved its accessibility to the wider synthetic biology community, facilitating collaboration. agrEcoli optimises fertiliser use, saving farmers' money and reducing environmental damage.",

Recovery strategy will consist of a new adhesion mechanism that enables bacteria to bind to silica surfaces through the expression of the L2 ribosomal protein, attached to the outer membrane protein AIDA-I. A quantifiable, highly-sensitive luciferase-based reporter system coupled to an oligomeric metallothionein is expected to increase our system’s capability of arsenic sensing and chelation.",

Towards this goal, we mutate and select microviridins, which are tricyclic depsipeptides from cyanobacteria. They are small but stable due to their post-translational side-chain crosslinking. Microviridins have a high potential for therapy as they can block disease-relevant proteases. Yet, the possibilities of cyclic peptides are largely untapped since genetic systems for optimization are not well established. Thus, we developed synthetic systems for the mutation, selection and production of such peptides. We use the 6.5 kb microviridin (mdn) gene cluster cloned in E. coli plasmids, established random mutagenesis and generated focused libraries of microviridins. For selection against a panel of proteases, we are applying and testing phage display, and we are constructing a novel in-vivo selection device, which links protease blocking to antibiotic resistance. Our systems, including the 6.5 kb cluster, adhere to the BioBrick standards.\"",

As the discovery of new antibiotics lags behind, we are developing new methods for targeting the resistance itself  - making resistant bacteria sensitive to old antibiotics once again. Working with real-world resistance genes from multi-resistant bacteria isolated at hospitals, we are developing anti-resistance systems to strike at three different levels: DNA, transcriptional and translational level.\r\n\r\nAt DNA level, we develop a method for increasing resistance plasmid loss rate.\r\nAt transcriptional level, we use super-repressors to repress transcription of resistance genes and native defense mechanisms.\r\nAt translational level, we develop a modular system for high-throughput screening of sRNAs to silence resistance genes.\r\n\r\nWe also provide tools useful for the whole synbio community, such as new standard backbones and methods for scarless gene deletion.\r\nWith this team on this project, there is no question about it: Resistance is futile!",

S. aureus is one of the largest causes of hospital infections, each year infecting millions of people around the globe. S. aureus is normally commensal, but can create biofilms on implanted medical devices and in post-operational wounds. Biofilm is increasingly hard to treat, as a result of growing resistance to many types of antibiotics. By manipulating E. coli to express a synthetic RIP peptide tagged with an export signal, we hope to reach this goal. RIP has been shown to hinder the quorum-sensing processes essential for biofilm development in S. aureus, thereby making it harder for the bacteria to cause infections. We propose making a bandage that contains our engineered bacteria behind a semipermeable membrane, allowing only small peptides such as RIP to pass through, into the wound.",

While it is rare in industrialized nations, cholera remains a major threat in developing nations; there are an estimated 3-5 million cases resulting in over 100,000 deaths annually.  West Point's 2011 iGEM team is developing a simple test kit to determine the presence of cholera contamination in drinking water. Inserting a plasmid coding for Beta-Galactosidase (_-Gal) enzyme induced by an arabinose promoter (araBAD) into E. coli creates a biological specimen that will produce the _-Gal in the presence of arabinose.  When the modified specimen is mixed with cholera the _-Gal is released into solution where it reacts with X-gal, also in the solution, producing a blue-violet color.  If no cholera is present, the solution remains clear.  Our technique should produce visible results in the order of minutes, rather than the typical day(s) it currently takes for similar techniques.\"",

In our engineered cells one of these Che proteins is fused to a synthetic light-sensitive localization system. Two external inputs - red light and far red light - induce the relocation of the fused proteins, thus reversibly changing flagella movement direction. Cells, imaged by bright field microscopy, are automatically detected and tracked while a closed loop controller guides the cell into a user defined direction by autonomously sending light inputs. This makes our engineered cell the smallest remote controllable living robot on earth.",

Mathematical modeling has always been an important component of engineering disciplines: models and computer simulations can quickly provide a clear picture of how different components influence the behavior of the whole, reaching objectives quickly.  Our presentation focuses on sophisticated mathematical models of synthetic biological systems that connect the targeted biological phenotype to the DNA sequence. The activities for iGEM 2009 included the development and testing of simulation tools that connect multiple levels of organization from molecules and their interactions, to gene regulatory relations, to emerging logical architectures in bacteria. We connected out tools to the Registry and validated the simulations with a significant experimental component, constructing and testing these synthetic biological systems in Escherichia coli.",

We want to construct a system where the cells with higher growth rate could transform into the slower ones which has a different function.

Additionally, we developed a construct for treatment and submitted a new part to the registry, NucB, which is a nuclease that targets extracellular DNA necessary for biofilm. Future applications of this project include incorporation into plants to naturally prevent food rot as well as the possible development of a probiotic for human consumption to prevent the pathogenesis of bacteria whose toxicity is dependent on quorum sensing. In addition to this project, we isolated and submitted the 6 essential genes in the Lux brick (LuxA,B,C,D,E, and G) from its original source, Vibrio Fisheri, because many teams have been unsuccessful with the previously submitted Lux parts.",

We aim to create a synthetic biological device to produce nutrient for people who needed. The device contains sensing, synthesis, and lysis system which is operated in E.coli. When the device senses appropriate signal, it will activate synthesis system to produce nutrient. When products reach a critical mass, the lysis system will take over to release nutrient. We take_-carotene as one of our source of nutrient, as it is the precursor of vitamin A. 40 millions people worldwide suffer night blindness each year because vitamin A deficiency. In our device, we use hydrophobic promoter as our sensing system (_-carotene is lipid soluble), and lysogenic enzyme as our lysis system. Our next step is to transform our synthesizer to lactobacillus which is harmless to human so we could solve the global food crisis problem.",

        "abstract": "The methane-producing archaeon Methanococcus maripaludis was synthetically modified via expression of a gene to produce geraniol synthase (GS) from Ocimum basilicum. The GS gene was cloned on a methanococcal shuttle vector downstream of a strong promoter, and transformation of methanococci was confirmed via PCR.  GS catalyzes the conversion of geranyl diphosphate, an intermediate in biosynthesis of the isoprenoid lipids of these archaea, to geraniol, the major aromatic compound in roses and a potential biofuel. Small amounts of geraniol biosynthesis were detected in cultures of the transformants by GC/MS.  Methanogens are archaea that live in the guts of humans and animals and are responsible for the methane content of flatulence.  Thus, this project could convert personal polluters into an air freshener.  Because of the prevalence of flatulence among the aging population of the United States, the potential impact of this research is very high.",

Democratizing Synthetic Biology will demand fundamental advances to make DNA construction easier and cheaper, thereby enabling broader access to biotechnology by the public. Our team has tackled this challenge with the design of an inexpensive self-contained kit called GENOMIKON, currently targeted for the high school and DIY communities but with clear potential for professional use. The kit contains prefabricated parts that are sequentially assembled on a solid support using cycle times of 5 min./part with a coupling efficiency of ~95%. The parts exist with sufficient diversity and quantity for hundreds of unique experiments. The kit is accompanied by an online resource that serves as lab manual, notebook, information management system and social network for the exchange of ideas. While similar in concept to our last year's project, GENOMIKON differs in most technical aspects and is far superior in performance.",

This protein prevents ice crystal formation in the cell, which in turn allows survival at very low temperatures. We develop a switch by adapting the cold-shock E. coli operon with AFP from a fish (Macrozoarces americanus) using a positive feedback circuit. A very important potential application we are interested in is the use of AFP in designing systems helping crops to avoid potential damage from frosts.

The Etch-a-Sketch circuit enables a lawn of bacteria to be drawn on with a laser. This seemingly inconsequential task presents many engineering challenges: the bacteria need to be sensitive in order to respond to a laser pulse, yet selective to use in ambient lighting. The second circuit allows bacteria to emulate a digital full adder. The circuit makes use of individually non-functional split reporters that can reform functional reporters with the help of fused 'zipper' domains. In addition to the circuit, we have made easily fuse-able BioBricks of these domains in order to facilitate the engineering of more split proteins, which should assist in the creation of logic circuits. MYS!S aims to improve the parts registry by checking and giving directions to modify Biobricks to conform to assembly standards. \"",

It interacts with the anti-Shine-Dalgarno (ASD) sequence in the 16S rRNA in the ribosome to initiate protein translation. By mutate the basepair in the SD and ASD sequence, we produced an orthogonal translation system where the canonical ribosome cannot translate the orthogonal mRNA, and vice versa. We call this system O-Key. Using the O-Key, we are able to strictly control the synthesis of desired product and prevent potential contamination to the publics and environment. We can even build a completely new orthogonal phage that can only infect our engineered E. coli. With these successful examples, we demonstrated a bright and secure future that guarantees the safety of the human and environment with our O-Key.",

In addition, we introduced an inducible secondary bacterial population that can trigger system-wide self-destruction, conferring an additional level of user control. Each module of our system was characterized using fluorescent reporters and the integrated parts were evaluated by controlled experiments involving wound signal gradients. We envision a probiotic solution that can facilitate localized tissue repair for damage resulting from inflammatory bowel diseases, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.",

In order to investigate mobility and directed movement towards a substance, an effective mobility selection method using special “swimming plates” is designed. Additionally, we attempt to improve E. coli’s swimming velocity by creating new parts derived from its own motility apparatus. Based on our selection system, we identify variants of chemoreceptors with new binding specificities in the mutant library. By these means, we aim to train the bacterium to detect new molecules such as tumor cell markers.

Our engineered communication platform consists of controlling OMV production by destabilizing membrane integrity through over-expression of specific periplasmic proteins (e.g., TolR). In order to control and modulate message content, we used fusions with OmpA signal sequence and the ClyA hemolysin as delivery tags. A targeting system was developed, based on the outer-membrane expression of Jun/Fos leucine zippers to control the vesicle flux between donor and recipient cells. Once received, the signal from incoming vesicles is transduced through a modified Fec pathway, whereby the receptor is provided by the OMV. Computational models provided insight to all of the above steps. Such reliable communications systems have wide biotechnological implications, ranging from targeted drugs delivery and detoxification to advanced division of labor or even cell-based computing.",

We investigated a simple representational intercellular signaling network where a population of cells synthesizes and secretes an activator molecule capable of activation a second population of cells into synthesizing and secreting an inhibitor molecular which feeds back and inhibits the production of the activating molecule.  This is known as an activation-inhibition system.  We began by using a partial differential equation model of the system to explore the effect of varying the separation distance of the two populations of cells.  We found that three types of dynamics were present: steady states, periodic oscillations, and quasi-periodic oscillations.  We further designed two strains of E. coli capable of interacting with each other as an activation-inhibition system and endeavored to validate our modeling results in a biological system.",

A high-energy diet, increases the amount of LPS-producing gut microbiota, and increased LPS levels has been observed in obese individuals. By inducing changes in the gut microbiota by prebiotics, like inulin, it is possible to decrease the plasma LPS level. This is associated with the stimulation of bifidobacterial growth. We have designed a novel approach to address this issue of plasma LPS, by probioticly induce changes in the gut flora by genetically modifying a bacteria to produce plant originated inulin. We cloned the two genes encoding sucrose:sucrose fructosyltransferase (SST) and fructose:fructose fructosyltransferase (FFT) from the Jerusalem artichoke into a E. coli, where it will produce inulin by using sucrose as an acceptor molecules. In the future this construct should be introduced by a probiotic lactobacillus, into the gut.",

        "abstract": "\"Paracrine cell signaling typically occurs through chemical messengers. Such signaling is limited by diffusion coefficients and unique cell properties, and cannot easily be controlled in therapeutic applications. The goal of this project was to demonstrate light-based cell signaling in mammalian cells. Using luminescent proteins and optogenetic tools, we constructed 'Sender' and 'Receiver' HEK 293T cells which send and receive blue light, respectively. The Sender Cell expresses a 480nm light emitting protein. The Receiver Cell expresses Channelrhodopsin-2, an ion channel gated by 480nm light. When the Receiver Cell is illuminated, Channelrhodopsin-2 opens, triggering a second luminescent protein via calcium influx. Since the luciferases in this system require an externally added luciferin substrate, we have also been developing Pre-coelenterazine, a genetically encoded luciferin which could allow our system to function autonomously. Our light signaling system has eventual applications in interkingdom signaling and optical controlling of synthetic networks.\"",

Therefore, we created a BacillusBioBrickBox (BBBB) composed of reporter genes, defined promoters, as well as reporter, expression, and empty vectors in BioBrick standard. B. subtilis naturally produces stress resistant endospores which can germinate in response to suitable environmental conditions. To highlight this unique feature using the BBBB, we developed Sporobeads. These are spores displaying fusion proteins on their surface. As a proof of principle, we fused GFP to the outermost layer. Expanding this idea, we designed a Sporovector to easily create any Sporobead imaginable. Because the Sporobeads must be biologically safe and stable vehicles, we prevented germination by knocking out involved genes and developed a Suicideswitch turned on in case of germination. With the project Beadzillus, our team demonstrates the powerful nature of B. subtilis.",

This complexity hinders an easy control and regulation of attachment and detachment. We will give Escherichia coli a simple, effective and controllable mechanism for biofilm formation based on the strong glue from mussel feet. E. coli, expressing the strongest-binding mussel foot protein Mfp5 on the outer cell surface, can robustly attach to a wide variety of surfaces, including glass, plastic and itself.  Using highly sensitive TIRF  microscopy and atomic force measurements  we visualize and characterize the localization and attachment of cells. Combining these results with our mathematical models allows us to predict the attachment speed and stability as well as cell clustering and settling. The controllable, strong attachment opens up new possibilities for the use of bacterial machines in environmental applications, medicine and industry.\"",

The cleaning of E. coli will be possible thanks to the colicin protein. The activity of these proteins will be controlled by a biological pH-stat, using light-driven cyanobacteria to control pH of the media.We will deliver a DIY kit as a prototype platform for killing pathogens responsible of diseases such as cholera, diarrhea and typhoid fever, ending with more than 2 million deaths in the last year according to the 2011 WHO Guidelines for Drinking-Water Quality.W.C.

In this optic, the Grenoble iGEM team has built an ultra-sensitive pathogen detector. It consists of three interconnected modules: 1- Detection, 2- Amplification/ Communication and 3- Output. The detection module consists of a recombinant membrane receptor that, once activated, actuates an amplification loop. The amplification system contains a genetic feed forward loop, which filters out false positive outputs. Once amplified and filtered, the signal is transmitted to neighboring bacteria via a diffusible molecule. In turn, the amplification loop is triggered which leads to the production of a measurable fluorescence output. The design of our network is easily adaptable to different input signals by using other receptor domains.",

We aim to introduce the genes that are required for ethylene production into Escherichia coli under the control of an inducible promoter, in an attempt to develop a cleaner and non-energy intensive method of production.

High temperature (370C), native quorum sensing molecule (AI-2) and the darkness present in the fermentor will keep the self-killing system turned off. Environmental signals such as low temperature (25 0C), foreign quorum sensing molecules and light encountered by the E. coli outside of the fermentor would trigger the self-killing device.

Bearing in mind that one of the purposes of iGEM is to link biology and engineering sciences, we'd like to implement an easy way to manage those simple steps in biological systems.Unfortunately, in E. coli, it's still difficult to assemble or delete in one step, because there is a lack of genetic tools to execute homologous recombination with linear DNA. By the assembly of a unique plasmid containing different phages' genes, and the design and construction of helper plasmids, we aim to provide the iGEM community with a system that would confer to E. coli the useful properties of controlled homologous recombination.We called this plasmid for insertion and deletion of genes : Pindel.",

This can lead to bacterial evasion of host defense systems and susceptibility to some pathogens. Since nowadays we are exposed to continuously stress, perhaps we can avoid the negative effects caused by this condition. Thus, a mechanism that counteracts this imbalance is highly desirable. The ability of some bacteria to sense stress hormones such as Catecholamines will be used to produce Interleukin-12 and inducing Th1 lineage. On the other hand, the ability to sense Nitric-Oxide released in inflammatory conditions will be used to trigger Interleukin-10 production, counteracting excessive immunity. A switch control system will sustain the balance. The 'Jedi Bacteria' containing these devices would be a useful probiotic to fight against the battle imposed by stress.\"",

Each of the three first operons will respond to a specific quorum-sensing system (QSS) and trigger another QSS resulting in a chain reaction communicating a unique signal to all bacteria nearby.\r\nWe also developed our model in silico to run simulation and test parameters that influence pattern propagation on a petri dish.",

CooA switches on oxidation enzymes in Rhodospirillum rubrum (a purple, nonsulfur, phototrophic bacterium) which enables the bacterium to use CO as a carbon source. CO is an odorless and colorless gas which can be extremely lethal. Our aim is to develop a cell sensor which can detect a wide range of CO concentration in the environment.

By upregulating the metal-reduction pathway of  Shewanella oneidensis in the presence of a target compound, these sensors can act as a continuos monitoring system. While our system is adaptable to sensing a wide range of analytes, we have focused on the detection of arsenic-containing compounds and naphthalene, which are common contaminants in oil sands tailings.

To help solve the problem, we design a gene circuit which can both detect and defend against the phages. We use the modified promoter pRM to sense the phage’s infection and initiate the defence. The lysis gene which can make bacteria lyse is installed in our circuit. When it works, the phage won’t be able to take advantage of its host to replicate any longer. To win more time for lysis to function well, we design antisense RNA to prevent the phage from turning into lytic life cycle. Thus, when the lysis protein kills the host, the phage is still at lysogenic life cycle or the newly assembled phages are still immature. By using the quorum sensing system, the bacteria around the host will prepare to defend in advance. Attribute to these parts, our bacteria survive.",

Biofilm-related problems are major concerns in the food industry where it can cause food spoilage or poisoning, in health industry because of pathogens' persistence and dispersal, or in the oil and water industry where it causes corrosion. Assuming that the environment is already over-saturated with harmful chemicals such as biocides, whose long term health effects remains to be elucidated, there is a great need for innovating solutions to reduce detrimental biofilm effects.\r\n\r\nTo reduce the use of biocides, the INSA-Lyon iGEM team aims to engineer a bacterial \"torpedo\" capable to infiltrate and destroy biofilms formed on industrial equipments, pipes or reservoirs. Industrial surfaces will then be protected from further deleterious contamination by either a surfactant coating, or the establishment of a protective biofilm produced by the torpedo bacteria.",

The NRP-UEA team have developed novel biobricks, which provide a foundation for a system with this level of complexity. The project began with a simple idea with widespread applications: the detection of exogenous nitric oxide (NO). However it soon became clear the detection of highly reactive NO was challenging, and this was addressed in two main ways. A bacterial promoter, PyeaR, was fused to its mammalian counterpart, CArG. The functionality of this flexible dual promoter was determined in both mammalian and bacterial chassis. Yet it was determined that further specificity was still needed, leading to the comparator circuit, that subtracts the expression of one promoter from that of another, allowing for signal integration and quantitative computing.  This system thus allows for the detection of any chemical, providing the promoters have overlapping specificity.",

Bacteria could be designed to perform promising tasks, such as the biodegradation of oil to clean up oil spills. Yet, there are risks associated with the possibility of living bacteria performing undesired activities. Our goal is to introduce a 'bio-safety net' that will be applicable to virtually all genetically engineered bacteria as a vital termination step after their tasks have finished. We have made this possible by introducing a 'suicide' mechanism, that will be triggered under specific conditions. By combining different promoters, the system can respond to changes in  environmental factors and control expression specific to chosen factors. Such mechanism can be easily assembled and incorporated to bacteria through the use of biobricks.",

Appropriate signal peptides and penetratin are used to facilitate peptide secretion and intestinal uptake. Furthermore, we design a circuit with quorum sensing and double repressors, which aims to generate quick but sustainable responses and serves as an anti-noise filter. Plasmid stabilization modules including partition system and multimer resolution system are also incorporated to circumvent the undesirable loss or segregational instability of our artificial device. With this general concept of delivery of short peptide into human body, we can also target other human diseases with alternative circuit designs.",

These promoters can be valuable tools in monitoring the environment for salt, heavy metals, temperature, and more. Second, we want to develop a real-time monitoring model of these stress-inducible promoters by having fluorescent reporters linked to their expression. Current research typically uses microarray, a technique that takes a 'snapshot' of a system, where as we want to hold a 'video camera' up to specific genes. Third, we will show the advantages of using Nicotiana tabacum protoplasts (NT cells). Our NT cell system provides a faster, cheaper, and safer method of obtaining a transgenic plant model than transforming an actual plant, benefits future iGEM teams may want to take into consideration.",

When these criteria are met, the E.coli cells will undergo lysis, and release the toxin colicin, which our cells are producing constitutively.\r\nWith our project, we want to show that one of the biggest challenges in medicine can be solved by synthetic biology.",

To date, it has been difficult to overcome primary brain cancer resulting from GBM, primarily because the cancer-initiating cells are suspected to be highly resistant to current cancer therapies. Specifically, CD133+ cells have shown resistance to hypoxia, irradiation, and some forms of chemotherapy. CD133+ hunting machines will be created by genetically engineering microglial cells (BV-2) with mammalian expression vectors. The project will also take advantage of inherent qualities of the microglia such as constant environmental sensing and quick motility. The engineered BV-2s will be equipped to locate the specific GBMs and label the targeted cells with a tat-GFP fusion protein. It is the goal of this study to show an alternative approach to cancer treatment, and to emphasize the power of biologically available options to fight the disease.",

This project is aimed to create a graphical user interface for designers of synthetic biosystems. This would help them in their design process by simulating the system. The midterm objective is to base the software on the database of biological material, fed by other iGEM teams.

RNA scaffold is designed to colocalize enzymes through interactions between binding domains on the scaffold and target peptides fused to each enzyme in engineered biological pathways in vivo, which may suffered from low efficiency of production caused by relative lack of spatial organization of non-homologous enzymes. The scaffold allows efficient channeling of substrates to products over several enzymatic steps by limiting the diffusion of intermediates thus providing a bright future for solving the problem. Meanwhile, we plan to add an aptamer structure on RNA scaffold as a switch to regulate biological pathways by micromolecular ligands. Then we can control the all-or-none binding relationship between the enzymes and scaffold by whether the special ligands are presented or not.",

Can a complex system be divided into independent modules that reside in different cells and interact with each other using nucleotide and protein mediated cell-cell signalling to act as a single unit? We seek to address this problem using a three pronged approach. Firstly, we are trying to introduce natural competance genes into the biobrick framework which will act as nucleotide importers. We are also building a protein export system using the TAT dependent export pathway. Finally, we are attempting to construct a multi-state turing machine which is a compound, modular computational system that has independent, interacting states which applies the above principle. We hope that this approach overcomes the obstacles in building more complex and composite circuits.",

We designed a modular Plug and Apply system that enables modifications to these coat proteins. The system facilitates the linkage of numerous ligands to the coat protein, thereby creating site-specific carriers. After expression of coat protein genes in Escherichia coli the VLPs were assembled in vitro, yielding modified Virus-Like Particles. Medicines can be packed using the Plug and Apply system or simply by addition during VLP assembly. Concluding, VLPs can be used as universal carriers for site-specific drug delivery, allowing customization to a variety of diseases while decreasing side effects for patients during treatment.",

We designed a set of concentration detectors that measures different range of the input signal and respond only to a specific concentration interval. By combining and spatio-temporal coordinating such concentration detectors we attempt to construct a biological clock that display time. The concentration band components themselves would work as a quantitative sensor that can work in combination other chemical sensors, such as toxic metals to life saving enzymes, which previous iGEM teams have come up with. Apart from this utility, we believe the concentration band detect sensor in different configurations can allow the creation of complex circuits ranging from simple oscillators to complex data processing machines which can exist on the same system without affecting other components of the system owing to its concentration band specificity.",

Further, it is theoretically possible to create complex control circuits using combinations of invertible DNA sequences. We utilized the recombinase HbiF to augment an existing system in Escherichia coli that relied on the recombinase FimE. A burst of induced, low level expression of one recombinase will invert the promoter flanked by the recombinase binding sites, triggering a switch from strong expression of one set of proteins to another set. Induced expression of the second recombinase will revert the promoter to its original orientation, triggering the original set of protein expression. The inversion will be sustained across cell divisions with little leaky protein expression and negligible performance degradation after repeated inversions. This is a heritable, binary memory system and can be used as a component in more complex systems.",

        "abstract": "Our goal is to engineer a novel biosensor with a faster readout than is currently available. Many bacteria produce, secrete, and respond to chemicals called autoinducers to monitor population density and to synchronize gene expression, a process called quorum sensing. In quorum sensing based biosensors, detection of autoinducer activates transcription of a reporter gene, which must then be translated and accumulate to detectable levels, which can take two to four hours. In our system, we will use TraR, a protein used in the quorum sensing response of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which dimerizes only in the presence of its autoinducer. We have successfully fused traR to sequence for two separate complementary fragments of GFP. Upon addition of autoinducer, we predict that already accumulated TraR-GFP fragment monomers will dimerize, allowing the GFP fragments to interact and fluoresce. This new approach may drastically reduce the time necessary for future biosensors to produce detectable output.",

The transduction of the adhE knockout found in JW1228-2 to FMJ39 will produce a triple mutant with the following genes deleted: ldhA, pflB, and adhE.

Oil spills can pollute air and water and alter ecosystems for years. For this reason, last year's Panama team designed a BioBrick that can biosynthesize rhamnolipids under the presence of rhamnose and beta-hydroxyalkanoic acids. Rhamnolipids have emulsifying properties that reduces the surface tension of water, making the hydrocarbons easier to recover and biodegrade. This year we want to create a BioBrick that provides rhamnose for rhamnolipid biosynthesis and for other purposes as well. We also want to create a bioremediation system using existing biobricks that will produce the rhamnolipid while biodegrading the hydrocarbons in vivo. The system will be designed to operate with a lysis gene that will kill the cells once bioremediation of the contamination site is done.",

A single transistor \r\nis not a computer, they need to communicate with others to \r\nperform new logic operations, but how our bacterial transistors can \r\ncommunicate? In  2011, Ben-Yehuda et. al. identified a type of \r\nbacterial communication mediated by nanotubes that bridge \r\nneighboring cells, providing a network for exchange of cellular \r\nmolecules within and between species. By using these nanotubes \r\nour bacterium will be capable to communicate with others so that \r\ncreate complex networks of logic gates. Using this it could be \r\npossible to develop a complex network of \"transistors\" to create, for \r\nexample, a synthetic metabolic pathway.",

However, several serious issues remain: cytotoxicy, narrow dynamic range, and dependency on laser and exogenous chromophore. To circumvent these, Peking iGEM has rationally constructed a hypersensitive sensor of luminance- Luminesensor. Primarily, the sensor was designed by fusing blue-light-sensing protein domain from Neurospora with DNA binding domain of LexA from E.coli, following which protein structure inspection and kinetic simulation were conducted to rationally perform optimization. Amazingly, Luminesensor was proved to be as sensitive as to sense natural light and even bioluminescence. With this sensor, spatiotemporal control of cellular behavior, such as phototaxis, high-resolution 2-D and 3-D bio-printing using dim light and even luminescence of iPad were shown to be very easy. What’s more, we successfully implemented cell-cell signaling using light, which is the very first time in synthetic biology and of great importance for biotechnological use.",

Weighted items are represented by TetA alleles that confer measurably distinct levels of tetracycline resistance in E. coli. Excess TetA kills the cells; insufficient TetA can be screened by plating on tetracycline plates.  Each TetA allele is coupled with a distinctive fluorescent gene, and both are flanked by variant lox sites. Cre protein can invert or excise floxed DNA, yielding different combinations of expressed TetA alleles.  We constructed different TetA alleles by altering codon optimization and characterized the consequence of changing the order of two genes (TetA and RFP). Furthermore, we designed and tested a total of 11 new lox sites for site specific recombination.  We developed several open access software tools for the wider synthetic biology community.",

        "abstract": "\"Heavy metal ions of human origin contaminate waters worldwide and represent a major threat to human health, especially in lesser developed countries. The compliance with strict drinking water quality standards as a prerequisite to a healthy living requires qualitative and quantitative methods for monitoring metal ion concentration. Applying standard chemical methods is costly, complicated and sometimes requires high-tech machinery, which is often not available.We therefore aim at creating a set of bacterial biosensors for some of the most toxic heavy metal ions found in drinking water, by fusing metal-responsive promoters under the control of transcriptional regulators with reporter genes such as GFP. The biosensors will be evaluated to qualitatively determine the metal ion specificity and subsequently quantitatively describing the concentration-dependent output of the reporters. Such a tool kit can be applied to quantify the metal ion content in water samples in an easier and cheaper way.\"",

This would be accomplished by expressing the required enzymes, encased in a proteinaceous bacterial microcompartment. This construct is necessary in order to shield the cell from toxic intermediates which would otherwise make this biosynthesis impossible. Azobenzene derivates are interesting in the field of biochemistry because of their properties as synthetic molecular switches. Project 'ApoControl' is divided into three subprojects on controllable cell-death. The goal is to develop a system to improve the efficiency and specificity of gene expression in eukaryotic cell-lines and more specifically, to select cells expressing the target gene against cells that do not. Here, proapoptotic genes instead of antibiotic resistance are used as a selection marker to induce clean cell-death at different stimuli.",

A series of symmetric logic-toggle modules, or briefly speaking, AND-OR switching gates, are designed to act as the basic parts of this Cell PLD. The idea comes from PLD which is widely used in electronics engineering. Hopefully, the construction of these modules in the cell will be achieved, with the help of the site-specific recombination systems. Feedforward control theory is introduced into the module and mechanism on the behavior has long been under our analysis, all aiming at a better performance of the logic gate. Modeling as well as computer simulation will help to evaluate and thus improve the robustness in this process.",

In Silico modelling tools are needed to assess the performance of artificial networks prior to assembly. Genome biofabrication must achieve rates well beyond existing methods using a modular design so that the extent to which natural systems can be made artificial can be tested. We have taken our first steps towards these goals by directing our efforts to the rational refactoring of the E. coli genome. Using flux balance analysis we have identified 117 new genes that may be essential for survival. We have developed and validated a rapid, modular biofabrication method (BioBytes) and have produced BioBytes for 150 of  our 447 essential gene list. We have also built a Lego Mindstorm-based DIY biofab robot and extended the concept to a BioFab-on-a-chip prototype.",

Characterization and analysis of the gene cluster is underway. \r\n   Phosphate and nitrate sensor have been finished respectively, together with three test devices which facilitate our quantitative analysis. More detailed measurements are underway. Once those sensors work as expected, N/P as input would better match our model.\r\n   Fine-tuned comparators and ratio sensors with sRNA-mRNA interactions serve as the processor for decision-making. This model-driven part would take advantage of our fine-tuned N/P sensors and synthetical RNA interactions together to accurately alarm red tide.",

Rhamnolipids as biosurfactants are important in the remediation of oil spill areas. The cleanup of the Exxon Valdez oil spill using rhamnolipids as biosurfactants was too expensive and complicated, therefore impractical for large-scale bioremediation. However, with advances genetic engineering and synthetic biology offer a viable solution to oil spill pollution clean up. In this project we use genetic engineering as a tool to integrate genetic parts through the BioBrick assembly standard protocol of iGEM to develop a BioBrick for rhamnosiltransferase 1 complex (rhlAB) gene expression in Escherichia coli for standardized rhamnolipid production. Our BioBrick integrates a promoter, a RBS (ribosomal binding site), our part rh1AB gene sequence isolated from Pseudomonas aeruginosa, a GFP reporter and a terminator. All the parts fit into a plasmid backbone that can be transformed into E. coli strains, which can then produce rhamnolipids.",

        "abstract": "Although 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows' marks the termination of J. K. Rowling's popular novels, we recreate a fantastic world where patronus are produced by Saccharomyces cerevisiae to fight against dementors inside the cell. Ethanol fermented by yeast from lignocellulosic materials can be an environmentally friendly fuel. However, rapid and efficient fermentation of lignocellulosic hydrolysates is limited because of inhibitors generated during pretreatment in addition to monomeric sugars. Inhibitors strongly affect the normal physiology of yeast as well as its ethanol productivity, just like the dementors taking away people's hope and happiness. Nevertheless, we reconstruct TOR protein, a central component of major signaling transduction network controlling cell growth, to increase the tolerance of yeast. A new TOR after directional mutation will play the role of patronus to defend the influence of inhibitors, keep the overall signaling networks in good order, and finally provide a prosperous world for ethanol production.",

Our proposed design uses a radical crosslinking reagent to crosslink PHB monomers in cell lysate, released upon a light-induced lysis gene network. We hope to apply this printing ability to three-dimensional printing, offering a cheap alternative to current rapid-prototyping technologies. Our work involves characterizing an infrared promoter for light-lysis, experimenting with PHB production in cells, and the design of a dual-wavelength printing system. We discuss how this system could be generalized to create a framework for actuating groups of cells in any 3D volume to theoretically modulate behavior more complex than lysis. We also plan to apply special consideration to the ramifications of possible commercial enterprises developed in iGEM competitions with open source biological materials, such as BioBricks .",

We built a vast number of both simple and complex genetic circuits that were characterized using flow cytometry. These genetic circuits were built using an assembly technique called MoClo (developed by Weber et al., 2011), which involves a multi-way, one-pot digestion-ligation reaction, enabling faster and more efficient construction of genetic circuits. We converted a large subset of BioBrick™ Parts from the Registry (http://partsregistry.org/) into MoClo Parts using PCR and cloning strategies. We built and characterized various genetic circuits using MoClo Parts and compared them against their pre-existing BioBrick™ counterparts in order to compare the characterization results from the two assembly techniques. We also created a standardized data sheet to be included in the Registry of Standard Biological Parts for each Part we characterized to easily share our data with the synthetic biology community.",

The iGEM team of the Eindhoven University of Technology developed an innovative electro-biological equipment which will be the replacement of your old television screen in the future! They proudly present to you the SOMY – LCD, the Super Optimized Modified Yeast – Light-emitting Cell Display. It’s a multicolor display, in which genetically engineered yeast cells are electrically stimulated to induce a fluorescent light response and consequently function as pixels. Since calcium takes the leading part in this process, the yeast cells are engineered with fluorescent calcium sensors and extra voltage-gated calcium channels.",

Evidence shows that natural plant miRNAs can be ingested into mammal bodies and target specific genes. Such discoveries show us a promising approach to perform cross-kingdom information transpotation and gene regulation. \r\nWe propose a method of controlling animal gene expression and helping cure disease by creating vegetable that produces artificial siRNAs targeting critical genes for some disease. This time, we chosed PGC-1 alpha gene, which is over-expressed in fatty liver and contributes to insulin resistance, as the target. This concept can provide us a better perception of our daily diet and a new way of curing disease. \r\nOn the other hand, we expand the boarder of iGEM by working on green plant. Firstly standardized binary vector is constructed. Also, we designed a brand divece for transgenic plant to help solving potential safety problems.",

Cadmium is a toxic heavy metal which has no known biological function. Ingestion of cadmium contaminated water can induce bone fractures and severe renal damage. Major sources of cadmium contamination include fertilizers, sewage sludge, manure and atmospheric deposition. Cadmium contaminated sewage is often used for irrigation purposes in many parts of the world, especially in developing nations. Crops grown in these contaminated soils are then sold in markets without any detoxification treatment. Current analytical methods such as atomic absorption spectroscopy, though highly sensitive, are significantly more expensive than bacterial biosensors and are unable to measure the amount of bioavailable cadmium.",

Traditional antibody production method is expensive and time consuming. Thanks to the simple and easy-to-industrialize nature of prokaryotic systems, our antibody production system, once established, will facilitate the cheap and efficient production of antibodies. Production of antibodies in the mammalian immune system involves two steps: Random production of a large numbers of antibodies; Selection of a specific antibody matching the antigen. Therefore, our Antibody Production System would be composed of two devices: Module I: Generation of antibody library; Module II: Selection of specific antibodies.",

We are developing the components necessary to create a tailings pond clean up kit for removal of harmful by-products.  The first component uses the xylene degradation pathway of Pseudomonas putida optimized by the use of a protein microcompartment produced from the engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein lumazine synthase.  The second component  removes heavy metals by producing nanoparticles with the Magnetospirillum magneticum protein Mms6.  The third component causes sedimentation of fine clay particles using natural properties of Eschericia coli and cell aggregation with Antigen 43.  The final component removes the genetically modified organism's DNA by using restriction endonucleases.",

Our mammalian system uses newly isolated mechano-sensing promoters and a bi-stable toggle to stimulate osteogenesis via transient mechanical signals. Our bacterial system uses a toggle that takes advantage of quorum sensing and cell response to UV light and triggers the production of fluorescent proteins, and a polymer composed of a matrix of cross-linked phage. Our systems are remarkable because they translate a macroscale input into a pattern that emerges from the growth and re-modeling of cells. This technology not only has applications in the field of self-repairing nanotechnology and medicine, but it is also shedding light on artificial differentiation and the use of phage display technology in a new and innovative way.",

However, current high throughput screening methods are time consuming and extremely limited by cell growth rate and rate of gene activation. In order to address these issues we’ve created an optogenetic tool kit in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using the CIB1/CRY2 optogenetic system. In this system, the CIB1-VP16AD and CRY2-Gal4BD fusion proteins dimerize in the presence of blue light leading to gene expression at the Gal1 promoter. Using flow cytometry we characterized four different fluorescent proteins for use in our tool kit using a galactose activation assay. After characterizing our network, also using flow cytometry, we developed several protein expression assays for medical genetics. Finally, in order to confirm network success in silico, we utilized the modeling software TinkerCell to generate a stochastic model of our optogenetic network.",

Plasmids commonly used in molecular biology are mobile genetic elements that facilitate horizontal gene transfer in the wild and enable the spreading of antibioticresistance genes between microorganisms. Plasmids contain unique DNA sequences that can be targeted by the CRISPR system. We exploited this system by engineering E.coli with an inducible mechanism of self-curing plasmid based antibiotic resistance.  We synthesized a version of CRISPR encoding a spacer that matches the GFP DNA sequence. We tested the synthetic CRISPR array against E.coli harboring a tetO::GFP plasmid that confers ampicillin resistance.  Activation ofCRISPER-gfp destroys the gfp-containing plasmid restoring the bacterial host's sensitivity to ampicillin. We will use the synthetic CRISPR system as a biological tool, combining it with other BioBricks for use in applications that will impact health and medicine, biotechnology, molecular biology, and genetics.\"",

Pipe breach detection and the restoration of pipe integrity were implemented through exploitation of chemotaxis, and cell lysis that releases a two-component protein-based glue (lysyl oxidase and tropoelastin). Control was achieved using an AND gate with quorum sensing and the lac inducer IPTG (released from the breach) as inputs. Deterministic and stochastic models of the genetic circuit, integrated with an agent-based model of E.coli cells, were used to define the effective radii of cell migration and timing of lysis. Constructed AND gate, quorum sensing and lysis timing modules were experimentally tested. The two-component glue concept was successfully validated using in vitro alpha-omega complementation of beta-galatosidase activity. Finally, a proposal for an igem.org-based parameter database was developed to aid the rapid identifation of BioBricks parameter values.",

Promoters are the fundamental elements of every synthetic biological system. We have developed and successfully applied two novel, in silico guided methods for the rational construction of synthetic promoters which respond only to predefined transcription factors. Thus, we have been able to create a library of promoters of different strength and inducibility. To characterize the promoters, we have developed standardized protocols for comparable measurements of promoter strength by either transient or stable transfection. These synthetic promoters can be used as “spybricks” which enable the construction of assays for simultaneously monitoring several pathways in a cell. However, the potential of synthetic promoters goes far beyond this application: e.g. in virotherapy, these promoters could be used for selective gene expression in target cells.",

        "abstract": "Eukaryotic synthetic biology has huge potential, yet it is still in need of more diverse molecular tools for defined gene regulation. Nuclear receptors are a conserved family of proteins responsible for sensing lipids; they may be viewed as lipid activated transcription factors. We have successfully developed a kit with a variety of lipid responsive domains (from H.sapines, D.melanogaster and C.elegans) for the rational construction of synthetic transcription factors. The domains respond only to predefined lipids and selectively activate predetermined gene expression. To characterize theses domains, we used standardized protocols for comparable measurements. In vivo gene expression was measured as a function of ligand concentration using luciferase activity. The potential for these tools is immense; e.g. from the ultra sensitive detection of lipid contaminants in the environment to the opportunity of titration specific gene expression canges in patients undergoing gene therapy.",

However, quantitative information about the expression strength of a synthetic promoter has been difficult to obtain due to the lack of noninvasive and real-time approaches to measure the levels of both RNA and protein in cells. Here, we engineer a fluorogen-activated bio-sensor that can provide information on both transcription strength and translation efficiency. This biosensor is noninvasive, easily applied to a variety of promoters, and more efficient than existing technologies. To demonstrate the utility of our biosensor, we constructed and characterized several designed T7Lac hybrid promoters. Furthermore, we developed a mathematical model of our synthetic system to guide experiments and an open-source electronic kit that mimics experimental setup and well suited for education purposes. Our results could have a broad impact on the measurement and standardization of synthetic biological parts.",

It uses an engineered strain of Bacillus subtilis to detect and report volatiles in spoiling meat. The introduced genetic construct uses a promoter to trigger a pigment coding gene. This promoter, identified by microarray analysis, is significantly up-regulated in the presence of volatiles from spoiled meat. The activity of the promoter regulates the expression of the pigment reporter and will be visible to the naked eye. For safe usage of the system, spores of our engineered strain are placed into one half of a semi-permeable capsule, the second containing a calibrated amount of nutrients. Breaking the barrier between the two compartments allows germination and growth, thereby activating the spoiling meat sensor.",

Our 'bio-motor' aims to breach this gap to bring a foundational advancement. In our model, Escherichia coli cells are engineered to specifically express streptavidin at pole(s), which allows cells to adhere in the same orientation to a microrotary motor through biotin-streptavidin interaction. Thus, with the propulsion generated by bacterial flagella, this synthetic device is capable to convert biological energy into mechanical work. Furthermore, the propulsion energy was programmed to be adjustable by controlling E.coli swimming speed, i.e. putting E.coli cheZ gene under the control of ptet. This technology has tremendous potential to be applied in various fields including biomedicine, bio-energy, and bioengineering.",

However, the recent explosion of interest from the emerging field of RNA regulation provides new insights into the dynamic nature of genetic regulation. Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) comprise the chief regulatory mechanism for eliciting primary responses to environmental stresses.  Acting in conjunction with proteins such as hfq (RNA chaperone), sRNAs provide a cost-effective, specific and rapid response that is essential in targeting gene transcripts for regulation. The Illinois iGEM team has worked to create a set of endogenous and artificial sRNA regulator Biobricks to be used in cellular stress responses and which contribute to bistability in artificial gene circuits. A bacterial metal detection system of arsenic and gold demonstrates the capacity of sRNA regulation in artificial gene circuits.",

We synthetically engineered S. cerevisiae to form tunable biofilm-like structures by inducing the display of adhesive proteins on their surface. By combining the natural yeast mating receptors - Aga1 and Aga2 - with adhesive proteins from a variety of organisms, we created several adhesive interactions among yeast cells. Our synthetic cell adhesions can serve as a model for biofilm formation and primitive multicellular structures.",

When combining them together, the configuration of RBS strength in genetic program can be fast and easily determined by variable concentration of external ligand and an RBS that meets this configuration will be automatically generated.\"",

Pseudomonas aeuroginosa was also used as a helper bacterium in the generation of electricity. The preliminary results indicated a production of banana odour by the bacteria. However, preliminary tests with the first MFC design did not result in a measurable electricity generation.

Contemporary methods of assessing water quality have a slow turn-around time so we have taken steps to perfect a biosensor for rapidly indirectly quantifying the presence of enteric bacteria in natural water samples through the detection of quorum sensing factors.  Previous IGEMS have exploited the LuxR/pLux system for the detection of a variety of N-acylhomoserine lactone autoinducers. We have taken steps to further perfect a biosensor based on this device by transforming a gram-positive bacteria host to eliminate any background autoinducer signal and to build-in an enzymatic 'read-out' to obtain an analog output.  We envision the development of a handheld monitor that uses this IGEM biosensor, immobilized on input paper strips, to rapidly detect unsafe levels of enteric bacteria in water samples.",

Past attempts at developing counters in cells have mostly attempted to mimic the binary methods that computers use to count.Our first counter takes a new approach to counting in cells, essentially a mechanical rotary counter implemented on a micro scale.  Each time the counter detects an input, it performs an excision and integration directly down-stream of the active site, turning on a reporter and rotating over one 'notch' on the counter.Our second counter operates on the wholly different principle that the statistical occurrence of a rare event in a large population can be modeled.  Each cell in our population harbors a construct that when stimulated has a small chance of excising a terminator and expressing a resistance gene.  The number of resistant cells is thus an accurate count of the number of input stimuli.",

        "abstract": "\"Our objective is to create a bacterial 'detect and alert' system as an aid for defending coffee plantations against fungi (rust). Our bacteria will detect chitin, an organic compound found in fungal cell walls, and alert the plant by stimulating an early hypersensitive response.Two strains of bacteria will be created: one that detects chitin using a two component system from V. fischerii and produces chitinase to attack the fungus as well as a signaling molecule to activate the second strain. This second strain will process and amplify the signal, and if it decides that there is a threat it will produce a second signal that mimics the internal alarm system of the plant to activate the hypersensitive response. The design is modular to allow other combinations of fungus-host plant systems to be created easily.We expect this biocontrol method to prove very useful for farmers and reduce fungicide use.\"",

In contrast to most glues, ours is natural, biodegradable, efficient on wet surfaces and has exceptional resistance (up to 3 times better than super glue). It is composed of a polysaccharide released by a Gram-negative bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus. Our aim is to use BioBrickTM standard biological parts in order to create a new strain of Escherichia coli which will synthesise this adhesive material. Moreover we are going to use a new plasmid stabilisation technique, the StabyTM system developed by Delphi Genetics. This system allows us to avoid the use of antibiotics and has been shown to be more efficient as far as protein secretion is concerned.",

However, the successful assembly of organisms that integrate multiple (>3) pieces of information into an elongated AND gate has yet to be seen. Our '4C3 leak-switch' realizes such a tool with the use of homologous recombination and leaky transcriptional terminators. This switch turns on only when three of four types of information are transmitted, regardless of the order of transmission, and outputs differently depending on the combinations of input. Our current project aims at creating bacteria that collectively solve the popular puzzle game Sudoku. This aim is achieved by combining this switch with our second subproject, the 'signal-virus,' which relays information only to the relevant targets, based on an antisense-RNA key system. This system realizes parallel-computing and we believe will greatly advance the field of information-processing.",

Rather than depending upon slow and expensive chemical synthesis, our team has developed two cohesive platforms utilizing the BioBrick strategy and synthetic biology to produce compounds for public health and nutrition using industrially-relevant microorganisms. First, we constructed and optimized designer pathways, using the BioBrick platform, for the production of a suite of sunscreen-like compounds that inhibit the effects of ultraviolet radiation, which we hope to incorporate into bacteria found on the skin microbiome for prolong ultraviolet protection.  We also developed a novel and modular BioBrick backbone for expression in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.  For demonstration, we constructed a caffeine production pathway in this backbone, generating a yeast strain which produces caffeine.  Both of these projects gain impact from their synergistic application of synthetic biology and bioengineering for products that apply to real-world situations for researchers and the general public.",

In contrast to this current paradigm, microbes have naturally evolved to survive as members of dynamic communities with distributed metabolism. This “divide and conquer” strategy allows the community to perform more complicated metabolic processing than would be possible in single microorganisms while being resilient to environmental changes. Despite very recent proof of concepts in developing model microbial consortia, or synthetic ecology, questions remain as to whether complex metabolic pathways can be engineered in context of microbial populations. The 2012 University of British Columbia iGEM team sets a precedent by engineering a tunable consortium with a distributed 4S desulfurization pathway for increased efficiency in the removal of organosulfurs in heavy oils and bitumen resources.",

The MCs detection device we design takes the advantage of Gal4 promoter, which consists of two domains, one is AD, the other is BD. When AD and BD are close enough to each other, the report gene transcription LacZ will be trigged. We selected and modified two peptides that have specific interactions with MCs and engineered them into two vectors to construct the Yeast Two-hybrid system. In the presence of MCs at different concentrations, blue dots in different shades of colors can be seen directly.",

Furthermore, the Cellular Logbook is able to infer the time of signal-onset or signal-intensity using the natural dilution of the registered signal’s due to cell division. \r\n\r\nIn short our exciting new memory module could potentially be utilized as a platform for many groundbreaking technologies.",

We have developed a regulatory system composed of three distinct functional modules.  The whole system is activated by thermal degradation of the repressor protein, which leads to internalisation of E. coli by mammalian cells. When in endosome, pH-dependent two-component regulatory system activity enables the bacterium to escape to cytoplasm. Once the bacterium is in the cytoplasm some proteins are secreted due to expression of specific genes. In our case, secretion of p53 or bax proteins to mitochondria leads to apoptosis without cell cycle arrest thus enabling complementation of traditional chemotherapeutical agents, which affect only proliferating cells.",

This bacteria’s metabolism relies on its ability to oxidize iron; the iron can then be used to oxidize, and in turn solubilize, copper. By genetically altering the bacteria, we intend to install a light sensitive mechanism which will enable us to etch copper in a desired pattern, leaving a finished circuit board. Once a blank printed circuit board is placed in a thin layer of solid media, the bacteria will be applied onto the surface of the media and light will be focused on it in a desired pattern. The light sensitive mechanism in ferrooxidans would activate and self-destruct in the pathway of the light. In the end, the circuit board will be \"etched\" by the bacteria everywhere but the illuminated spots, leaving the desired pattern behind on the circuit board.",

We propose to contend with such infections at a population level by triggering a defense system delivered by an engineered P4 phage.  P4 is a satellite of P2 phage, so it cannot assembly unless some P2 genes are present. Those indispensable genes will be expressed by an E.Coli strain, hence creating a production line of a P4 which will be able to deliver (transduce) standardized synthetic systems to E. Coli and possibly similar species. The defense system will consist of toxins for DNA and rRNA degradation, transcribed by T3 or T7 RNA-Polymerases, fast enough to stop phage's assembly and scattering. The system includes the spread of an AHL, hence \"warning\" the population to prepare against further T3 or T7 infection. We will implement a stochastic population model to simulate the infection processes and quantify the efficiency of our system.",

Then we standardize them to construct a general element used specifically in hypoxic tissues.\r\n  The hypoxic feature in the core areas of tumors made it possible for S. typhimurium to target tumors specifically.  Our goal is to screen the anaerobic promoter that can express efficiently in S. typhimurium and ligate it with genes of anti-cancer drugs. The double properties of the strains and promoters enable anti-cancer drugs to express specifically in tumors, fulfilling our goal of decreasing toxic and side effects of the drugs.",

The relE protein?toxin?, is an RNase that preferentially cleaves mRNA stop codons, severely inhibiting translation and preventing colony formation. Whereas expression of relB protein?antitoxin? and tmRNA forms a rescue system to reverse inhibitory effects. Based on these mechanisms our network functions as a bacterial bioclock oscillating between the two states of dormancy and activity. Potential applications of our project include lifespan prolongation of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, since the metabolic process of microbes is vastly decelerated during the dormancy state, just like that of bears and hedgehogs in their hibernation.",

Our project involves engineering S. cerevisiae to localize proteins to various points in the cell in response to light exposure. Under red light, a tagged protein of interest localizes to a specific target, while exposure to far-red light causes the protein to rapidly delocalize and diffuse throughout the cell. This is accomplished using the PhyB-PIF3 system, a light-based transcriptional regulation system found in Arabidopsis.  This project has two components. 1) Metabolically engineering yeast to endogenously produce PCB, a tetrapyrrole necessary for system activation, and 2) adapting the PhyB-PIF3 system to localize proteins of interest to different targets in the cell.  The versatility and applications for this system are vast, ranging from cellular diffusion studies to easily synchronizing cell division for entire populations.",

The use of quorum sensing can help transform an inherently analog molecular signal into a binary response and simultaneously allow the tuning of input response thresholds and signal amplification.  This project demonstrates these capabilities through experimentation and modeling.  Another candidate for reapplying an electronic engineering technique is the codesign of hardware and software to implement a function.   In synthetic biology, codesign might mean implementing a design spec in different expression control regimes and comparing their relative merits.  Our work examines the codesign concept by constructing an AND gate in three different design domains.  We explore the application of these ideas with an environmental sensor.  A unique aspect of our project is the collaborative nature involving five institutions at three locations.",

We first built a mathematical model to quantitatively predict RIPS (ribosome initiation per sec) of any given coding sequence in any organism. We then constructed three modules (synonymous substitution, optimization and RIPS design) to process input coding sequences. Bach could recompose the input sequence into an output one that better suits the host organism and performs the specific translational rate of desire. In this way, the discordant tunes of codon bias in biobricks from different genetic backgrounds could be synchronized, and the realization of a more predictable and robust system would be possible. Our work not only benefits current works involving exogenous protein expression, but also makes a big step towards standardization and characterization of biobricks.",

        "abstract": "The issues surrounding energy production are becoming more prominent with increasing environmental concerns and the rising cost of energy.  Microbial fuel cells (MFCs) use biological systems to produce an electrical current.  Cyanobacteria are organisms which have been studied in MFCs and have been found to create a current, although not highly efficient (Tsujimura et al., 2001).  We wish to increase the efficiency of the cyanobacteria MFC by introducing microcompartments to create a BioBattery.  The microcompartments are created by the production of the protein lumazine synthase forms icosahedral capsids.   As a proof of principle we will create this system within Escherichia coli and target two different fluorescent proteins within the microcompartment to observe fluorescence resonance energy transfer. Furthermore, we will be exploring a novel method for the mass production of uniform nanoparticles, which is more efficient and cost effective than current methods.",

Therefore, we would like to create a ” biolight” system that can reduce CO2 production and attenuate degree of global warming. We plan to create a new organism that doesn’t need electricity and cause no pollution. We named it “Midnight Apollo”.  The “Midnight Apollo” will be turned on when surrounding area turns dark and will be turned off automatically when the environment becomes bright. The idea is based on two systems, Cph8 and aeoquorin/GFP. The Cph8 is regulated by visible light that can activate protein translation of an illuminating system. Subsequently, this illuminating system would use aeoquorin/GFP to light up the environment. We hope The Midnight Apollo could be applied in producing energy-saved Bio-streetlamp, emergency Biolighting, or Biosearchlight.",

We have designed a versatile system which maintains any given plasmid DNA in E.coli by using user-defined selection pressures, limited only by the presence of a response element to said pressure, like most antibiotics, certain chemicals and physical conditions. Depending on this selection pressure, a custom plasmid retaining system can be designed and co-transformed with the plasmid of interest to maintain it.  A similar system can be used to “lock” the function of a gene of interest, like a combination lock, which is unlocked only when the cultures are grown in a pre-determined order of selection pressures. In principle, using this locking system, multiple plasmids can be maintained using a single selection pressure.",

Truncating an enzyme previously shown to limit counterproductive metabolic regulation in terpenoid synthesis, together with a genetic construct design enabling the setup of a modular biofactory, potentially poses a foundation for applied interchangeable systems in synthetic biology. The need for reliable promoters for P. pastoris is addressed by characterizing four inducible promoters as standardized parts useful in controlling gene expression, with GFP as a reporter. The functionality of peroxisome-targeting signal PTS1 for use on the C-terminus of gene products is also analyzed. Difficulties in designing laboratory protocols and engineering genetic constructs are approached by developing a multi-purpose software tool to solve methodological obstacles, as well as facilitating implementation of a modular design on future projects.",

        "abstract": "The widespread use of caffeine (1,3,7–trimethylxanthine) and other methylxanthines in beverages and pharmaceuticals has led to significant environmental pollution. We have developed a novel detection and bioremediation strategy for caffeine contamination by refactoring the methylxanthine degradation operon native to Pseudomonas putida CBB5. Escherichia coli cells with this synthetic operon degrade caffeine by N-demethylation to the guanine precursor, xanthine. Cells deficient in guanine biosynthesis and containing our refactored operon were addicted to caffeine; their growth density was limited by the availability of caffeine. Remarkably, they were able to sense the caffeine content of several common beverages. Characterization of nearby genes in the P. putida operon revealed a potential methylxanthine regulatory system for use in biological circuit design. The synthetic N-demethylation operon could be useful for cheaply producing pharmaceuticals or precursor molecules and for detoxifying waste so that it can be recycled into animal feed and biofuels.",

Using synthetic biology tools, we designed, built, and tested two new systems to fight infections by both broad types of bacteria - Gram-positive and Gram-negative.  Our first project targets Bacillus anthracis, the Gram-positive pathogen that causes anthrax.  We re-engineered an enzyme to remove the pathogen's protective coating, rendering it defenseless against the immune system.  In our second project, we re-engineered and transplanted a protein secretion system capable of combating Gram-negative bacteria into E. coli.  This system was designed to target Gram-negative pathogens in a modular and controllable fashion.  These two systems are the vanguard of a new era of antibiotics using the power of nature harnessed with the tools of synthetic biology.",

However, plants are a major focus of synthetic biology due to their potential use in an array of applications from food security to synthesis of biofuels. The short time scale of the iGEM competition has often meant that plant based projects are challenging and there have been very few in previous years. As the first iGEM team at UEA and in co-operation with the JIC, we felt that we could make a significant contribution to plant based synthetic biology. The overall aim of our project is to help develop and where possible pioneer some of the fundamental technologies and methodologies needed to make plant based synthetic biology projects possible. To achieve this we hope to adapt existing synthetic biology approaches which are successful in Escherichia coli for use in plants.\"",

Total crude oil replacement based on a 20% fuel titer and current fuel demands would require 5.6 trillion gallons of fresh water per year. Current fresh water supplies may not support this added demand. Alternatively, a sustainable approach may use a portion of the Earth’s 3.5x1020 gallons of ocean water. However, current fuel-producing organisms are unable to thrive in ocean-level osmolarities. Glycine betaine, a powerful osmoprotectant, shields organisms from salt-induced stress.  Wild-type Escherichia coli can acquire glycine betaine from their surroundings or synthesize it from environmental choline.  Two enzymes, glycine/sarcosine methyltransferase, and sarcosine/dimethyglycine methyltransferase, catalyze three successive methylations of glycine for de novo synthesis of glycine betaine.  Here, we demonstrate an engineered E. coli with an increased growth rate under salt induced stress.  We highlight utility by demonstrating the improved growth of fuel producing bacteria in ocean water.",

        "abstract": "\"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic pathogen commonly found in immunocompromised patients.  In addition to being the primary cause of lung infections in cystic fibrosis patients, many severe nosocomial infections can be attributed to P. aeruginosa. Currently, the standard detection method requires a potential sample to be grown overnight and then screened for the pathogen of interest. Our goal is to create a faster detection method without sacrificing reliability or experimental resolution. To realize our objective, we harnessed the native cell signaling and quorum sensing machinery of P. aeruginosa.  Quorum sensing in P. aeruginosa is a complex hierarchy that governs the expression of numerous virulence genes. Quorum sensing elements from P. aeruginosa were transplanted into E. coli and used to express detectable reporters. We are thus creating a novel biosensor capable of detecting the presence of P. Aeruginosa both quickly and effectively.\"",

It has a robust Type I secretion system that secretes a single protein, RsaA. This is a surface layer protein that totals 10-12 percent of all of the protein in the cell. We created a toolbox of biobrick parts that enable this system to secrete any protein of interest when fused to the C-terminal secretion signal of RsaA. Because Caulobacter is cheap and easy to grow but cannot survive in a human host, it has the potential to be an efficient chassis for enzyme-based drug delivery. As a proof-of-concept, we engineered non-biofilm forming strains of Caulobacter to secrete two enzymes, Esp and DspB, which have been shown to degrade biofilms. We tested our strains and demonstrated that our recombinant enzymes are secreted and that they do inhibit Staphylococcus aureus biofilm formation.\"",

We characterized two auxotrophic yeast strains (for tryptophan and histidine) and designed novel biobricks that regulate the export of Trp and His rich peptides. \r\nIn the future this would allow for other modules to control the proportions of each strain, thus allowing dynamic and stimulus dependent changes in the abundances of each strain.",

        "abstract": "A key challenge in metabolic engineering is to improve productivity and yield.  Potential applications range from the production of valuable compounds such as therapeutic molecules and biofuels to the degradation of toxic wastes.  There is increasing recognition that spatial organization can play an important role in optimizing pathway efficiency.  Specifically, the spatial co-localization of consecutive enzymes in a pathway can result in efficient translocation of substrates between enzymes, an effect known as enzyme \"channeling\".  Here we report the design, modeling and construction of a bacterial micro-organelle based system for the targeted co-localization of selected enzymes.  Our \"Encapsulator\" represents a fundamentally new class of parts which, in nature consist of metabolic enzymes encased within a multi-protein shell reminiscent of a viral capsid.  Micro-compartments based on encapsulin (and similar proteins) represent an experimentally amenable system to investigate the effects of channeling in potential downstream applications.",

We have focused on vitiligo in where pigment cells are destroyed, resulting in white patches on the skin. Studies have shown that vitiligo patients have decreased levels of antioxidants and elevated levels of antibodies targeting the pigment cells in the skin. We have used synthetic biology to fuse cell-penetrating peptides to proteins that are deficient in skin of vitiligo patients. The cell-penetrating peptides will aid in passing the proteins through the skin and target the pigment cells to reach repigmentation. Currently there are no treatments like ours for vitiligo patients. However, we strongly believe that synthetic biology can help bacteriotherapy getting a major role in fighting several skin disorders in the future, and that our first explorations in this field inspires others to continue exploring.",

Its growth rate decreases drastically at lower temperatures and growth completely halts below 7C.The aim of our project is to increase the cold tolerance of E. coli by expressing and combining several chaperone proteins that are normally found in psychrophillic bacteria. Chaperone proteins are essential in maintaining correct protein folding following changes in temperature. Therefore, expressing these proteins will likely enable enhanced growth rates at temperatures below 37C and shift the minimal growth temperature down from 7C, possibly even allowing growth near 0C.Our project is fundamental in its nature, but any application outside the labs, from biofuel production to bio-sensors, will benefit from the ability of icE.coli to grow at low temperatures, since this will relieve the burden and costs of maintaining the temperature constant at 37C. Moreover, we envision a temperature-based selection as an alternative to antibiotics-based selection.",

However, it is virtually unknown between unicellular organisms, much less between unicellular organisms of different kingdoms of life. Our team has constructed a system that allows for interspecies, bacteria-to-yeast optical communication. To permit bacteria to send an optical signal, we expressed in E. coli a red firefly luciferase under IPTG induction. In yeast, we used a yeast-two-hybrid-system based on the interaction between the red-light-sensitive Arabidopsis thaliana phytochrome PhyB and its interacting factor PIF3. Interaction between PhyB and PIF3 is induced by the red light from the bacteria, resulting in transcription of the lacZ gene. This is an excellent demonstration of the principles and potential of synthetic biology: this system not only allows for interspecies optical communication, but enables us to optically bridge a physically separated canonical lac operon using light as a trans-acting factor.",

It allows for tight regulation of conditional gene expression (started upon illumination with a blue light) through a photo-sensitive domain coupled to DNA-binding and activating domains. We are also developing and building a custom bioreactor setup to create the appropriate conditions for the LovTAP switch to work, and modeling the behavior of our system. Development of optogenetics has mainly been focused on bacteria but we are also comparing our project to another mammalian system, developed by Fussenegger et al. (Science Vol. 23, 2011), that uses a melanopsin switch to trigger endogenous calcium-driven promoters. Light-induced gene expression eliminates the need for activating molecules in sensitive applications such as the production of therapeutic proteins in the pharmaceutical industry.",

The aim was to control chemotaxis such that bacteria will be attracted to a defined substance followed by the ability to travel back to another stimulus at the start location, upon activation of an IPTG inducible toggle switch. Two riboswitches were used to control the translation of a CheZ fluorescent protein fusion, the first sensitive to theophylline and the second to atrazine. Fluorometry was used to prove the activation of the riboswitches. A theophylline concentration of 1.5mM resulted in the highest expression of the fusion protein. Motility experiments indicated that CheZ mutants regained motility in the presence of theophylline. Since riboswitches can be engineered for many substances, this system has possible applications as a networking template in multiple situations, be they industrial or medical.\"",

As a first step, we want to develop a genetic logical AND-gate sensitive to light of two different wavelengths (e.g. blue and red light). The bacteria are then immobilized in a transparent gel matrix, where they can be precisely actuated when hit by both blue and red light at the same time. If both of these inputs are positive, gene expression is induced. Various different gene products can be expressed using this system. For example, a simple colored pigment will allow us to create colored three dimensional objects. Expressing collagen and consecutive biomineralization and generation of hydroxylapatite could be used to create bone. \"",

We have designed, constructed and characterized an inter-specific translator based on light pulses that allows to literally dialogue with microorganisms. We have built seven biobricks with fluorescent proteins under the control of environmentally-sensitive promoters. The process is as follows: human voice messages are electronically- and then light-encoded in excitation wavelengths, and microbial proteins’ emission wavelengths are electronically- and voice-encoded back. We have used this system to find out the fermentative status of budding yeast and to dialogue with E. coli allowing it to answer questions such as “are you hungry?” The three pillars of our project (human practices, modeling and wetlab) yielded continuous feedback with each other, illustrating an integrated interdisciplinary approach. For example, in human practices, we qualitatively analysed the risk of cheater mutants (“liers”), which was quantitatively supported by our results in both our modeling simulations and in the wetlab.",

So we designed a heavy-metal-detecting E. coli. In order to design the system, we employed two fluorescence proteins (GFP, RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. The aryl acylamidase converts a colorless acetaminophen(Tylenol TM) to a brown color substrate. Since the detecting E. coli has three heavy metal promoters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the E. coli emit mixed fluorescence, so we simultaneously detect metals. Our goal is to synthetic modules put these three genes for different heavy metals in a row in E. coli and then utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable so that analysis of water is easily processed. We call it a 'Capsule Cop'.",

Our team has engineered disruptor /E. coli/ expressing mutated toluene-4-monooxygenase, which facilitates indole degradation. Introducing this disruptor strain into an /E. coli/ culture of HR and LR individuals is thus hypothesized to result in massive LR cell death at a lower-than-expected antibiotic concentration. If successful, indole degradation may become a possible strategy in boosting antibiotics effectiveness in medical practices against bacteria relying on similar signalling methods. We are also constructing a novel strain of /E. coli/ that utilizes an essential gene (/nadE/) for antibiotic-free transformation and plasmid maintenance. This strain can help future iGEM teams reduce their antibiotics consumption without deviating significantly from widely used transformation protocols. \"",

Such artworks can give rise to a number of issues and metaphors accompanying the advance of science and technology. Astonishingly, there are still few collaborations between bio-art and synthetic biology. In this context, we engineered Salmonella enterica cells to function as new painting tools in bio-art. Specifically, we try to program cells to automatically form various pattern and gradation of colors by sensing cell identity and density by means of quorum sensing. Moreover, we will extend these tools for actual paintings and artworks to consider the ethical implications such as ’view of life’. This collaborative project can show the social situation or question of life science.",

        "abstract": "One major goal of synthetic biology is to use common chassis (E. coli, yeast) for the production of drugs and useful natural products. This practice often requires placing large enzymatic pathways into one cell. Production of the desired product is usually affected by increased metabolic burden or negative feedback on the cell. In nature, however, many organisms work symbiotically to accomplish a task and/or provide mutual benefits to one another. For the first part of our project, we have studied two systems to create cellular codependence in E. coli - using either pairs of auxotrophs or toxin/antitoxins. In the second part of our project, we split a model metabolic pathway (violacein production) between two separate strains. Our goal is to create a tunable system to control population ratio of strains in co-culture in order to maximize the yield of a product.",

Three major parts comprise the system: A chitin-sensor system that is activated in the presence of Hemileia vastatrix (coffee rust) or, alternatively, a device that senses 3OH-PAME, a diffusible signal of Ralstonia solanacearum, cause of bacterial wilt. A second construct, the communication device, receives the input from the sensor device and starts the production of salicylic acid, a plant hormone that stimulates an hypersensitive response in the plant. The third part, toxin-antitoxin systems, will be either placed in the final plasmids or in the chromosome in different combinations, causing the cells to stay dormant most of the time without pathogen presence, and also ensuring no transfer of plasmids to other cells.",

In our project, we constructed a bio-film like Domino E.coli community, aimed at achieving an expansive and rapid biological signal processing system.

Cell-to-cell communication systems are important because, in most synthetic biology applications, the desired tasks are generally accomplished by a population of cells, rather than by a single cell. The proposed communication system could be used for creating a distributed sensors network, or it could help to better understand and possibly reduce antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Furthermore, we have conducted a survey to study the perception on synthetic biology and related ethical issues, among iGEM participants, students and supervisors. We have focused on the top-down and bottom-up approaches as applied to biology.",

The time switch we made counts the replication number of a single yeast cell, and triggers the activation of a certain gene (death gene, for example) when the replication number of the cell reaches the pre-set level. The work is an attempt to use the special quality of telomere and the end of chromosomes in the construction of synthetic biology device. Our system utilizes a whole new mechanism that is seldom used in cell counting device, and it enables us to delay the expression of a certain gene for generations. By control the life span of a certain cell, it sheds new light on the biosafety concerns and can be used for fields such as the protection of intellectual property rights.",

Circadian rhythms are one of nature's most exquisite mechanisms to regulate and synchronize biological processes over time. Our team has taken advantage of the fine time control offered by the circadian clock machinery to construct a genetic circuit that allows robust oscillatory behavior in a synchronized and predictable manner. We have coupled the expression of genes of a bioluminescent pathway to the endogenous circadian clock of Synechocystis PCC 6803. The benefits of using Synechocystis as our chassis for practical applications include minimal production costs due to its autotrophic growth capacity and precise synchronization to time-dependent events using environmental cues such as light. As a direct application we designed the first self-rechargeable programmable bio-lamp. Secondary projects include a novel secretion system, the first spider-silk biobrick and an optimization of the Gibson assembly reaction for small parts.",

All parts are BioBrick compatible and introduced into plants through agrobacterium-mediated transformation, using existing plant vectors modified with the BioBrick multiple cloning site. The Harvard iGarden is an effort to raise public awareness of synthetic biology, production of food, and how the two can intertwine.

This pathway is controlled by a certain wavelength of red light, acting as a system switch for lacZ production. LacZ can react with substrate X-gal and form a blue precipitate as a reporter. However, other reporter genes can be attached to the lacZ gene, so different reporters can be expressed. From the fact that this mechanism is sensitive to a certain wavelength of light, we hope to create a system that can be sensitive to various wavelengths and hence triggering different protein generation. Through this the E.coli can become a wavelength sensor; a different wavelength can trigger a different production of protein, for example various types of fluorescent protein, giving a different a colour-scaled indication of the wavelength of the environment around the E.coli.",

The Calgary iGEM team aims to alleviate this potential environmental and economic threat by developing a detection and bioremediation system for these toxins: FRED (Functional, Robust Electrochemical Detector) and OSCAR (Optimized System for Carboxylic Acid Remediation). FRED detects multiple compounds within one sample using an electrochemical output.  We created an open-source hardware and software platform to be used as a biosensor prototype.  For OSCAR, we designed and modeled a bioreactor to remove impurities (sulfur, nitrogen, and carboxylic acids) from tailings ponds. Known degradative microbial pathways were combined with unique engineering solutions in a bioreactor model. Furthermore, we developed ‘Ribo-kill-switches’ to prevent antibiotic resistance and disturbing natural flora.  Overall, this system aims to detect and convert toxins into clean hydrocarbons in an economical, safe, and self-contained process.",

Rice, which is the staple diet of India and many other countries around the world, is believed to engender many potential greenhouse gases or global warming gases per se like carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. Nitrous oxide, is released due to the inevitable use of nitrogen fertilizers which are added in the paddy fields. We are dealing with the conversion of nitrous oxide into nitrate form using synthetic biology tools to insert two genes into a bacterial cassette along with its detection systems. This nitrate, can be utilized by the plant itself, solving our purpose and adding a new dimension to this diversion and in turn being beneficial for the farmers reducing the compromise factor that would, otherwise, have been done.",

Our aim is to modify a bacteria normally found in human gut and create a safe, controllable and versatile molecular platform which can be used to produce a wide range of molecules  leading to a beneficial probiotic. For this purpose we have chosen the E. coli strain Nissle 1917 which has been used for many years as a probiotic. We designed a robust gene guard system regulated by a novel and easy to control inducible cumate switch that activates the production of a human antimicrobial peptide LL-37 that can kill the bacteria and also avoid horizontal transfer. \r\nThe safe probiotic constructed here can be used to produce nutritious, preventive or therapeutic molecules. For example, we have used it to produce an antibody against the emerging virus, Norovirus.",

The fledgling field of microbial fuel cell development has previously relied on anaerobic metal reducing organisms such as Geobacter sulfurreduccens. This project sought to isolate genes from the electron shuttling pathway in Geobacter and transform them into the more manageable aerobic Escherichia coli. The Missouri University of Science and Technology iGEM team isolated four outer membrane cytochrome (omc) genes from Geobacter, vital to the extracellular transportation of electrons. The four genes; omcB, omcE, omcS and omcT, were cloned into individual plasmids. The eventual goal is to combine all four genes into one plasmid to transform into E. coli to create an aerobic, electron transporting microbial system.",

Together these genes used UDP-glucose as substrate and synthesize. We aim to clone acs operon and transform it into environmental friendly and economical microbes in order to produce large amount of cellulose for paper industry. In doing so we minimized global deforestation as well as CO2 emission. We also aim to introduce acs operon into cyanobacteria which would used only light, CO2 and water to produce glucose and the acs operon to produce cellulose.

The bacteria were cultured in liquid media which is contained yeast extract powder and PET enrichment. The result of this preservation will be followed by the isolation of DNA and PCR with Cutinase F primer'ACGCGCCGGGCGTCACCGAGCA'3 and R 5'ACGCGTCGTGCCGTCAGGGCCA'3. Cutinase gen that were amplified will be inserted to plasmid pSB1C3. The recombinant plasmid which contained the cutinase gene will be introduced into E. coli.

The idea is demonstrated by constructing an odorant sensing module, coupled production of chemical attractant and production of pest-killing binary toxin in yeast to kill pests lured to the yeast culture. A chimera G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) responsive to an odorant chemical is coupled to the yeast mating pathway that can be activated upon ligand binding.  It leads to over-expression of an endogenous yeast transaminase that catalyzes a reaction to yield 2-phenylethanol.  Constitutively expressed binary toxin in the yeasts would poison the attracted pests after their consumption, as tested by feeding drosophilae. In addition to being a pesticide substitute, this cheaply-maintained engineered yeast strain also serves as a research reagent to screen for GPCRs that bind to certain ligands.",

Additionally, our interchangeable DNA probe confers modularity, allowing for a range of bacterial detection. Using a split beta-galactosidase complementation assay, we have designed three unique chimeric proteins that recognize and bind to specific pathogenic markers and create a functioning beta-galactosidase enzyme. This functioning enzyme unit then cleaves x-gal and produces a colorimetric output signal. Our research demonstrates success in initial stages of chimeric protein assembly.",

        "abstract": "RNA has characteristics that are important in human gene expression (i.e. alternative splicing of mRNA, noncoding RNA). Therefore, a modular RNA binding protein is an invaluable tool for gene regulation. The PUF domain of human PUM1 gene contains eight tandem repeats, each recognizing one of the four nucleotide bases. In theory, a PUF protein can be programmed to recognize any 8-nt ssRNA sequence. Here we demonstrate that PUF can be tethered with other functional domains for applications in E. Coli. Specifically, we show that a PUF/endonuclease fusion protein acts as RNA scissors, silencing gene expression through site specific mRNA cleavage. PUF was also tethered to split GFP to test its ability to co-localize proteins using a RNA scaffold. PUF biobricks offer a wide range of possible functions including gene expression modulation and scaffolding of metabolic pathways.",

By replacing the variable D3 domain of the fliC protein with proteins for binding, degradation, adhesion, and synthesis, we can increase the efficiency of bioremediation and biosynthesis, and facilitate the collection of products in situ or ex situ.

It's based on E. coli strain expressing invasion determinants: invasin from Yersinia pestis and listeriolysin (LLO) from Listeria monocytogenes. Invasin causes uptake of the bacterium into the mammalian cell by induction of endocytosis. Bacterial cells are lysed in the endosome and then LLO is released. LLO is a pore-forming toxin which causes endosomal membrane disruption and release of the payload (either protein or DNA) into cytoplasm of the mammalian cell. In order to fine-tune expression of genes used in our project we conducted measurement of various RBS parts included in 2010 spring distribution both from Community and Anderson's collections. We used standard measurement kit composed of promoter BBa_J23100 and GFP+terminator part BBa_I130401. We performed both relative and absolute RBS strength measurement.",

Cobalt is one of them, and is a major concern for these industries because of its high level of radiation.Currently, nonspecific ion exchange resins are used. Our E. coli 'Cobalt buster' strain aims at capturing cobalt specifically, even at extremely low concentrations, to increase resin lifetime and decrease the volume of nuclear waste. In a previous study, an E. coli strain has been modified by adding a transporter for cobalt and inactivating cobalt efflux pump.Then, our work focused on making this strain adherent in response to cobalt, via cobalt inducible production of curlis. These properties will enable to create an efficient biofilter, which will be easily separated from the effluent, allowing efficient and cheap bioremediation of trace cobalt in nuclear wastewater.",

Two different bacterial strains 'A','â€˜B' and one eukaryotic cell type 'C' will be engineered to establish mutualism: 'A' produces a N-acyl homoserine lactone (AHL) sensed by 'B', which in turn produces a different AHL sensed by 'A'. In addition, both bacterial cells activate,  through AHL, an enzyme necessary to convert cellobiose to glucose, which represents the only energy source for the whole consortium. The eukaryotic cell 'C' responds to AHL through a hybrid protein, thereby producing a secreted beta-lactamase, which allows the bacterial cells to grow in the presence of ampicillin. The creation of a consortium of inter-dependent cells from different kingdoms is expected to pave the way to multiple applications, since different cells might cooperate and, for instance, better produce complex molecules.",

L. plantarum was selected as it is already commonly found in yogurt. The aim of generating this novel probiotic is to reduce human morbidity via the subsequent increase in dietary fibre in the gut. The sequestering of glucose for fibre production by L. plantarum provides the additional benefit of effectively reducing dietary sugars. We have successfully extracted the four genes that code for cellulose synthase from the Acetobacter xylinum. These genes were then placed under the control of a strong constitutive promoter, and transformed into Lactobacillus plantarum. Plasmid and genome based expression of the synthase genes are being evaluated and characterized. In the future, cellulose production assays, evaluation of biofilm formation, and in vivo testing will be performed to determine viability as potential health benefits.",

Adapting the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (pGAP) shuttle vector to iGEM standards enables the expression of complex proteins in Pichia pastoris, due to post-translational modifications and a secretion system. We also plan to standardize the pPic9 shuttle vector for the same purposes.  Our second project involves the use of Agrobacterium tumefaciens, the causative agent of Crown-Gall disease in plants. The ability of this organism's Ti plasmid to insert foreign DNA into a plant’s chromosome is used to manipulate plants to express desired traits. These small plasmids house a cloning site and a selectable marker between the left and right border of the TDNA. The aim of this project is to modify a binary vector system to be compatible with the iGEM standard for the expression of foreign proteins within plants.",

Our system is based on a comparison between an unknown mercury concentration and a known IPTG concentration. A linear IPTG gradient is present on a test-strip containing the engineered bacteria. When the mercury solution is added, the regulatory network will switch to one of two states depending on the IPTG/mercury ratio. Bacteria become either 'sender' or 'receiver'. The bacteria sensing a predominance of mercury over IPTG, the 'senders', will release a quorum sensing molecule which is detected by the nearby 'receivers'. The reception of quorum sensing molecules will induce the expression of a red dye in the 'receivers'. In this way, a red line emerges at a position in the IPTG gradient from which the unknown mercury concentration can be deduced.",

This allowed us to construct a system, called “The Recombinator”, which automatically shuts down after successful recombination. We visualized the randomizing function of our genetically engineered slot machine by combining colors with cellular localization domains.\r\n\r\nBy scaling up the number of recombination modules and functional domains our system will be able to generate a multitude of new proteins.

Identification is also central to the human practices projects, which explicated and analysed the concept of identity in relation to the disciplinary backgrounds brought together in the project and the field of synthetic biology itself. Vibrio cholera was chosen as a test-case, giving us two potential routes to engineer E.coli to recognise the pathogen: 1. Fusion of cholera's receptor (CqsS) for its quorum sensing molecule (CAI-1) with the internal apparatus of one of E.coli's general stress detecting systems (BarA). 2. Engineer the whole cholera quorum sensing system into E.coli.Each of these would then be connected to a representation system (GFP or E.chromi) to visualize the pathogen.",

Quorum signaling allows bacteria to communicate with each other through the use of chemical signals. Bacteria use this form of signaling in nature to coordinate their behavior. Using three quorum signaling molecules we create unique connections between different populations of engineered bacteria and perform coordinated computing functions. We design and characterize standard and novel modules such as toggle switches, oscillators, signal propagators, and logic gates. As compared to engineering molecular circuitry in single populations, we aim to show that the synergistic approach to information processing leads to improved, scalable, and tunable operation.",

Production of ppGpp up-regulates central genes for starvation survival, and down-regulates genes involved in growth and proliferation, e.g. rRNA operons and the rrnB P1 promoter. ppGpp production is induced by amino acid starvation and other general stress and starvation factors, making this signal molecule suitable for monitoring stress in bacteria.The sensor consists of two parts. mCherry (a red fluorescent protein) controlled by the Lac promoter, and the Lac Inhibitor controlled by the rrnB P1 promoter.We observed a statistically significant reduction in fluorescence during growth compared to cultures with IPTG-inhibited LacI, demonstrating lacI production by rrnB P1. Results suggest that the rrnB P1 promoter produces less lacI when the cells are grown in minimal medium, possibly due to amino-acid starvation and ppGpp shutting it down. Computer modeling supports these results.\"",

So our team (NCTU_Formosa) managed to produce isobutanol by E. coli. With the temperature control system, we can reduce the toxic intermediates of synthetic pathway to enhance isobutanol yield. Furthermore, we add 4 zinc fingers to the synthetic enzymes trying to increase the chance of protein interaction, making E. coli much as a production line to produce isobutanol more efficiently.

For our biosensor device, reporter constructs were incorporated into the genome downstream of paraoxon and paraoxon-hydrolyis sensitive promoters. Our degradation device was designed in three parts, targeting paraoxon through expression of organophosphate hydrolase from Flavobacterium, sp and two of its degradation byproducts p-nitrophenol and diethyl phosphate. Each device was genomically integrated in order to bypass selective the need for selective condition, while the degradation devices were constitutively expressed for maximum efficiency. Combined, this two-part system allows for both the detection and remediation of a broad range of common and deadly neurotoxins.",

        "abstract": "Heavy metal contaminants in water pose serious health problems; the lungs, liver, kidneys, blood, digestive system, and the nervous system are all affected by contamination.  The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease registry released a Priority List of Hazardous Substances (ASTDR). Heavy metals accounted for almost half of the top 10 substances; therefore, we have constructed a set of sensors that detects heavy metal contaminants in water. Our sensors provide an inexpensive, simple, and visual test for Arsenic (the number one substance from ASTDR’s list), Lead (number two), and Cadmium (number seven).  One sensor paired  a promoter responsive to both Cadmium and Arsenic with GFP as a reporter. Another was created for the detection of Lead and a third  sensor was specific to  cadmium.  Use of the detector could potentially save lives around the world through early detection of the contamination.",

Biological systems provide an attractive opportunity to design and easily manufacture material with programmable properties. DNA origami demonstrated the power of this technology by creating a variety of assemblies that can be easily encoded in the nucleotide sequence. However, for biological nanodevices nature favors polypeptides over nucleic acids due to stability and versatility of amino-acid side chains. With few exceptions protein and peptide assemblies have been considered too difficult for the bottom-up design due to complex interactions and manufacturing problems specific for each case. We present technology for manufacturing nanomaterials based on combinations of modular peptide elements and protein domains, which allow self-assembly into complex tertiary structures with designed macroscopic properties. We will demonstrate the feasibility and potentials of protein nanotechnology by design, streamlining the production and technological application of nanomaterials based on nanoBRICKsPRO.",

In our model, to prevent E.Coli growth we modified non-infectious gram-positive bacteria B.Subtilis by transforming it with a construct, which was designed to produce limulus anti-LPS factor (LALF) together with a signal peptide. LALF is expected to bind and neutralize Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) found in gram-negative bacteria cell wall. On the other hand, to show E.Coli growth inhibition, we prepared another construct, which carries reflectin sequence with a signal peptide sequence and transferred into E.Coli. Reflectin protein produces color by reflecting light in different wavelenghts. This ability helps us to detect whether E.Coli is dead or alive.\"",

        "abstract": "Our work aims to illuminate the ancient Chinese philosophical theory called 'Wu Xing', also Theory of FIVE Elements, by artificially assembling a communication system between bacteria. This theory explains the composition and phenomena of the physical universe. In the system there exists close relationships classified as mutual promoting and restraining under certain conditions, by which functions of the various systems are coordinated and homeostasis of universe maintained. In our project, five modified nutritionally deficient bacteria represent the five elements in the theory. They talk to each other emitting and receiving specific signals called AHLs. Five pairs of signal receivers and producers, like luxR and luxI, are involved in achieving the process. Moreover, one will help another producing the essential nutrition for living while limit the production of a third member. Through such mechanism, the whole group survive and live in moderate coexistence, just like the effect of the philosophical theory.",

Cells containing synthetic DNA constructs that produce fluorescent proteins in the presence of AHLs could be used as in situ reporters of the AHL milleu in dynamic natural systems like biofilms and plant root nodulation. Additionally, cells that can produce AHLs could be used to alter the signalling in these systems and examine the results. Finally, different combinations and spacial arrangements of AHL inducible reporters, AHL producing cells and AHL degrading cells all regulated by the AHL milleu of the media could allow for information processing through the interactions between such nodes. Out team designed a number of AHL regulated nodes, devices that each respond to AHL levels in different ways, and attempted to build some of these nodes to characterize their behavior.",

We have designed a system of synthetic constructs implemented in an E. coli chassis that will allow detection of continuously varying levels of a single metabolic input and report on the concentration with qualitative output depending on threshold levels of the input.  Our system design utilizes RNA-level hairpin hybridization and antisense technologies linked to various reporters.  Because our approach is modular and does not depend on either endogenous protein processing or exogenous RNA, we envision that such a system could find applications in many different fields, including environmental sensing, detection of diagnostic of therapeutic biomarkers, and systems biology.",

We also undertook community outreach projects in order to enhance the synthetic biology community. Specifically, the Second Life platform was used to create an educational tool to train future synthetic biologists in an accessible, user-friendly, virtual environment.

We developed two projects, which aims are to introduce new properties in a system and to gain control over the information processing.\r\nThe first one hacks the way of transforming cells. It inserts and transcribes any protein inside E. coli, using only two steps: PCR and transformation. Using the Cre recombinase action and sequences flanked by loxP modified sites any open reading frame could be inserted and expressed in a plasmid ready to receive it inside the bacteria, called Plug&Play Machine.\r\nThe second one is a way to build a bacteria network with memory capacity, which works as a Hopfield Network.

        "abstract": "Hospital acquired infections are a global problem. One example is Clostridium difficile, a bacterial pathogen that infects patients undergoing prolonged antibiotic treatment and results in pseudomembranous colitis, a potentially fatal gut infection. This project aimed to design a synthetic bacterium that would respond to C. difficile infection and kill the pathogen in situ. Escherichia coli was engineered to secrete an endolysin from a bacteriophage that would specifically attack the C. difficile cell wall. The endolysin was fused to the extracellular components of an engineered Type VI Secretion System from Salmonella, which itself comprised 13 different proteins. In addition, a synthetic ‘inflammation biosensor’ was developed, based on a two-component system from Salmonella, with the aim of restricting endolysin secretion to the diseased colon only. Mathematical modelling was used to assist in the development of the laboratory work and to investigate potential therapeutic strategies beyond the scope of the experimental programme.",

A novel mechanism based on an E.coli chassis, was designed with two main objectives:  to sense arabinose reporting its concentration and to use light receptors to trigger the expression of the required pathways. The first receptor enables E.coli to activate (express), the arabinose sensing mechanism; whereas the second receptor activates a quick deactivation(degradation), of the sensing mechanism depriving the cell of that capability.",

Build-A-Genome provides students tools to meld seamless arrays of DNA into predesigned synthetic chromosomes. Our team develops new technologies for synthetic genomic fabrication. We developed a new standard, the Building Block, allowing production of much longer DNA sequences that can encode for more complicated cellular operations than allowed by current iGEM biobrick standards, as well as more standard iGEM-y devices. Through multiple rounds of homologous recombination we can create chromosome segments and eventually full chromosomes. We will present our improved methodology for building block synthesis, the software we have created to aid in our synthesis, applications of the yeast genome redesign and the new standard we have created. We will emphasize the Build-A-Genome course and its implications on future genomic technologies that both rely on and teach students.",

Our goal is to create a new assembly standard of biological parts in the form of pre-produced PCR-products, which can be directly mixed with a vector. This will make synthetic biology faster and assembly of an expression vector possible within a few hours. We have created a library of standardized biological parts for mammalian cells and fungi ready to plug'n'play. The simple and easy use of this new assembly system have been demonstrated by developing a reporter targeting system a mammalian cell line as well as for fungi. This novel assembly system represents an improvement of the conventional BioBrick assembly, which have its limits when creating synthetic biology with eukaryotic parts.",

Using Optimus Primer, primers can be designed for the selected Parts. Trumpet generates permutable constructs from these Parts by interleaving invertase sites among them. To assemble these permutable constructs, we present a Protocol Automation Stack comprising a high-level programming language called Puppeteer, executable on a robot. For improving manual protocol execution, we are developing an Electronic Lab Notebook that helps capture data, and schedule resources and lab activities. Our unique tools offer an end-to-end workflow that is collaborative, includes wetlab automation and organization, and provides algorithms for designing configurable constructs.\"",

The transistor will be based on a protein sequestration pathway that uses leucine zippers (bZIPs) Fos and Jun alongside synthetically designed dominant negatives thereof, eliciting a response dynamic similar to a signal titration. Furthermore, we intend to apply such transistors to function as signal amplifiers due to the ultrasensitive responses that can be generated in this mechanism. For the application of this project and others, we are also developing a high throughput gene expression screen for synthetic gene libraries and codon variants, allowing for the possibility of tunable gene expression levels.",

In Vibrio cholerae, there are two circular chromosomes, chromosome I and chromosome II, and each perfectly works as a chromosome. We've been motivated by V.cholerae's two chromosome system. So we employed some essential genes, parA, parB, parS, dif, and origin of chromosome II and contstructed a tiny miniature of V.cholerae's two chromosome system in E.coli, using BioBrick  assembly method. Also, we built software and database of essential genes for designing of minimal synthetic chromosome and genome. Essential gene informations were gathered  from some databases, DEG, EGGS, NCBI and java language was used. Our final goal is making useful, safe and stable synthetic minimal genome for Synthetic Minimal Cell. Although our project is feeble, we extremely believe that our project in this year will be worth first step for that.",

        "abstract": "Phytochromes, or photoreceptors with the ability to control the expression of genes, exist in bacteria as bacteriophytochromes. This project creates a light-dependent biological switch using the bacteriophytochromes from Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumefaciens. When coupled with heme oxygenase, these bacteriophytochromes are supplied with biliverdin, a pigment which allows for the self-assembly of a switch within the host system. In the presence of red light, the conformation of the bacteriophytochrome is modified. This reaction produces a visible colour change in the presence of red light, and can be used to control expression of a targeted gene when coupled with the appropriate response regulator. Exposure to far-red light will cause the bacteriophytochrome to revert to its original conformation, thus repressing the gene and reversing the colour change.",

Our project develops a system to engineer the genome of the photosynthetic cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC6803, establishes expression standards for this species, and adds a set of characterized Synechocystis promoters and ribosome binding sites to the BioBrick toolbox. We developed a BioBrick vector that can be used to assemble parts and devices in E. coli. Upon transformation into Synechocystis, it integrates the device directly into the genome through homologous recombination. We utilized genes that were activated under a variety of conditions, from those responding to heat stress to ones oscillating under a circadian rhythm. The promoters and ribosome binding sites were converted into BioBrick-compatible parts, and subsequently characterized. Our success will enable the use of existing parts in new species, and will expand the range of devices that can be built.",

Using cell cytometry (FACS) and fluorimetry, we demonstrated in yeast the successful expression and translational regulation of a fusion of mRNA binding protein and fluorescent protein. These results, along with published parameter values, were used to predict via deterministic and stochastic models that the probability of successful bistability for our switch was 0.96%, but this could be improved theoretically to a maximum of 51.27% by limiting the range of variation of the most sensitive parameters.  The models also predicted that co-operative binding of the mRNA binding protein to its mRNA stem loop was essential for generating switch-like behaviour.  These results suggest that a translationally regulated genetic toggle switch is a viable and novel engineering concept applicable to medicinal, environmental and technological problems.",

Our project aim to imitate the character of Wolfman, more specifically, designing two types of E.coli that help each other to survive at daytime, whereas competing at nighttime when cocultured.  Firstly, two cells have different types of antibiotic-resistance, however this expression is repressed in absence of outer stimulation. Two factors of stimulation, cell density and light, are required at once to activate the antibiotic resistance. We took advantage of photoregulation system (Cph1-EnvZ) to make sure downstream promoter is activated with light. This promoter is followed by circuit designed to sense the cell density of its counterpart and activate the counterpart cell's antibiotic-resistant gene.  With this entire system, we could observe the 'Wolfman' Coli in our laboratory working by AND gate of two stimulation.",

The aim of our project is the production of biofuels, alkanes, using bacterial cells as factories. Alkanes, so called 'Green' hydrocarbon fuels, are chemically energetically the same as petroleum-based fuels, thus no penalty for use of conventional engines is encountered from their use. For alkane biosynthesis, we designed a synthetic circuit using bacterial bioluminescence system and aldehyde decarbonylase from Vibrio harveyi and cyanobacteria, respectively. Free fatty acids in the cells firstly are reduced and converted to fatty aldehydes by LuxC, LuxD and LuxE and then fatty aldehydes finally are decarbonylated and turned into alkanes.",

In the AOX pathway, electrons are transferred from ubiquonone to AOX, and then directly used to reduce oxygen. The drop in the electric potential energy of the electrons transferred from AOX to oxygen is dissipated as heat. Our project has focused on 1) cloning the AOX gene from a thermogenic plant (Sacred Lotus) into E. coli to induce a thermogenic response to a cold-shock, and 2) calculating a theoretical rate of heat production per bacterial colony to select for an appropriate calorimetric technique. Further, numerical methods in MATLAB will be employed to model the steady-state temperature profile of the synthetic bacterial colony, and to potentially corroborate later experimental findings. Engineering a controlled thermogenic response in bacteria could lead to improved bacterial functioning in cold shock environments.",

Several iGEM teams based their work on the construction or use of biological flip-flop systems, with more problems than expected. The UPO-Sevilla team considers the design, construction and improvement of this type of systems, encompassing different regulation levels (transcription, translation, protein proteolysis and epigenetic regulation) in different model organisms, from bacteria to yeast. We leverage our informatics knowledge to improve biological systems, so we can control precisely the cellular machinery.In addition, we intend to develop a Foundational Advance for Synthetic Biology: the miniTn7 BioBrick toolkit, a transposon-based system to integrate BioBricks into microbial genomes. And a Software tool: the BioBrick Creator, to facilitate the design of BioBrick sequences and their inclusion in the Parts Registry.",

The two engineered populations communicate with each other by AHL signal transduction. We hope that compartmentalization of functions can lessen metabolism load and cross-reactions interfere, and achieve the assembly of different functions in bacterial level. The whole system comprises sensing, killing and biofilm formation devices. \r\n   Detecting device: to detect the existence of S.aureus through sensing the AIPs secreted only from S.aureus.\r\n   Killing device: to eradicate S.aureus through the production and release of lysostaphin.\r\n   Biofilm formation device: to enhance biofilm formation by over-expression of yddV, a di-guanylate cyclase, which catalyzes GTP into c-di-GMP.",

The iGEM Team Frankfurt wants to transfer the pathway of the plant into baker yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) to make stevia production much cheaper. Furthermore microbial production of these sweetening compounds could also lower the environmental costs of Sweetener production. \r\nIn addition to these advantages, it would be possible to selectively produce only the most flavorful compounds.\r\nSeveral of  known problems with carbohydrate sweeteners  like diabetes or caries could be overcome by the Steviolglycosides which are produced by Stevia rebaudiana. Another interesting perspective is the capability of Steviolglycosides to reduce the blood sugar value.",

These potent killers travel throughout the body, recognizing proteins and other molecules on the surface of target cells. If the target cell is deemed potentially dangerous, the cytotoxic cell grips the target cell tightly and creates an immunological synapse at the site of adhesion. Within this immunological synapse, the killer cell releases cytotoxic granules to kill the target cell without harming any nearby cells allowing for a direct, apoptotic death.   Our team will focus on improving the specificity and killing efficiency of cytotoxic cells towards certain cancer types. By using synthetic biology tools and logic gates' design, we hope to create powerful killing biomachines for the fight against cancer. Our newly engineered synthetic devices would have the potential to enhance current adoptive cell-based immunotherapy for cancer patients.",

This vector will facilitate exploitation of advantageous characteristics of these organisms, such as photosynthetic carbon assimilation.  Following expression, product recovery poses a difficult and expensive challenge. Downstream processing of cellular compounds, like polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), commonly represents more than half of the total production expense.  To counter this problem, secretion-promoting BioBrick devices were constructed through genetic fusion of signal peptides with protein-coding regions.  To demonstrate this, the secretion of PHA granule-associated proteins and their affinity to PHA was investigated. Project success will facilitate expression and recovery of BioBrick-coded products in multiple organisms.",

Furthermore, current standard BioBrick assembly protocols continue to be laborious, and have the tendency to deliver inconsistent results. To address this issue, team uOttawa has engineered two strains of S. cerevisiae that allow for the rapid integration of both transcriptional regulators and their trans-regulated promoters. Transcriptional factors (TF) and promoters transformed into these strains yield fluorescently tagged TFs or fluorescently reported promoters respectively. This dual-colour system enables the quantification of the relationship between TF expression and promoter responsiveness. To expand the registry with well-characterized parts, all of these tagged transcriptional regulators and promoters will be submitted. Finally, we also describe a fast, efficient and cost-effective assembly protocol developed by our lab that was used to assemble all constructs built by our team. \"",

A construct containing two adjacent start codons in different reading frames measures the E. coli DH10B ribosome’s proclivity for either one start codon or the other through a fluorescent protein reporter in each respective reading frame. Variations in RBS translation initiation rates and length between start codons provide additional data. Repeating sequences of non-degenerative threonine and alanine codons measure codon bias and determine E. coli DH10B’s ability to translate varying lengths of identical codons through the use of mCherry and GFP reporters. Promoters are tested for bidirectionality in protein translation by measuring the rate of forward expression through downstream GFP or reverse expression through upstream RFP. A ratio of fluorescence characterizes each tested promoter.",

The design has been generated with sustainability in mind, and aims to create an alternative to traditional fossil fuel technologies. The battery owes its capabilities to two strains of bacteria: the heterotroph Rhodoferax ferrireducens, and the photoautotroph Rhodopseudomonas palustris. Each strain will occupy its own concentration cell and after being cultured anaerobically, will either oxidize (in the case of R. palustris) ferris iron or reduce (in the case of R. ferrireducens) ferric iron. The resulting current will be collected and used to demonstrate the functionality of the battery. The reduction and oxidation reaction will be self-substaining. This process is further aided by the genetic modification of R. palustris. As a photosynthetic prokaryote, R. palustris generates glucose readily. We intend to share this glucose with R. ferrireducens by inserting a passive glucose transporter into the cells of R. palustris.",

One of the most exciting uses for synthetic biology is in the design of biological systems that can replace and improve industrial processes. By achieving industrial goals using biological processes, we predict dramatic reductions in economic and environmental manufacturing costs. Our project is a first step towards biologically synthesized electronic circuits. Based on precedence of naturally redox-capable bacteria, we generated a system in E. coli that reduces metal in solution. Depending on the application, this system has the ability to form a conductive copper sulfide that can be localized with high precision. In the future our bacteria could catalyze metal deposition to form electrical circuits of any desired dimension and complexity.",

Each generating different protein expression levels in order to test performance in reliability and consistency, but this process is both tedious and time consuming. To overcome this problem, our team provided a novel circuit design method_ Pathway Commander. We construct a single version of a synthetic metabolic pathway circuit that can use culture temperature shifts to control the expression levels of a series of metabolic proteins at the precise times. We have implemented the Pathway_Commander design in (1) Carotenoid synthesis Pathway, (2) Violacein biosynthesis pathways and (3) Butanol synthesis pathway in E. coli. This circuit design utilizes a temperature controlled system that gives precision control over metabolic protein expression which amounts to optimal synthesis that can maximize synthesis of a given compound or drug. \"",

Our project is to design a genetically engineered Escherichia coli which could be used for hydrogen production. To offset the low yields of hydrogen production through dark fermentation, the substrate would be the organic compounds found in wastewater. The mixed acid fermentation pathway, leading to hydrogen production, can be improved by both the overexpression and the deletion of several genes involved. In addition, we would like to implement various features to enable the strain to perform other tasks related to wastewater treatment, such as biosensor, eliminating nitrogen compounds, or hindering hydrogen consumption by methanogenic bacteria, as well as a planned death system in order to prevent its proliferation in the environnement. We also plan to adapt to iGEM standards the homologous recombination tool used for the deletions.",

Upon activation, our system will release a cholesterol degrading enzyme, a novel reporter protein and a vasodilator. The cholesterol degrading enzyme will break down the plaque. The reporter protein was chosen for expression because of its unique fluorescent property. This allows the plaque site to be identified in a manner similar to X-ray visualization. Finally the vasodilator will simultaneously dilate the blood vessels for better flow, as well as switch off the extended activity of our system.

The other one, “Cells in Cells” is the project to make a cell.  We defined making cells as making liposomes that can divide like mitochondria do.  To approach our goal, we set two subgoals.  One is to enable cells to take in liposomes.  The other is to enable the liposomes to import proteins needed for mitochondrial division.  We suppose this could be the first step to create artificial cells.",

A future novel application of the system is heterologous redox coupled protein production in yeast.  The USER fusion standard:  Another part of our project is the proposal of a new parts-assembly standard for Biobricks based on USER(TradeMark) cloning.

BacillaFilla would be applied to structures by spraying onto their surface. The Bacillus swims deep into the microcracks. Repair is effected by production of CaCO3, filamentous cells and Levansucrose. CaCO3 expands at the same rate as concrete, making it the ideal filler. A filamentous cell mesh provides reinforcement. Levansucrose glues CaCO3 and filamentous cells in place. B. subtilis 168 sporulates, making it ideal for storage and transportation. The cells are naturally tolerant to concrete's high pH. We repaired 168's defective swrA and sfp, regaining motility. At the end of the crack the quorum communication peptide subtilin triggers a co-ordinated population response from a subtilin-inducible promoter. Upregulating SR1 and rocF promotes arginine and urea production, increasing exogenous  CaCO3 deposition. Over-producing  yneA induces  the filamentous cell phenotype, while SacB converts extracellular sucrose to levansucrose glue.",

Also, it would decrease ice-melting of glaciers, thereby effectively slowing down global warming.The second function of E.D. Frosti is the anti-freeze function by the production of Anti Freeze Proteins (AFP). These bacteria could then be used as anti-freeze biofilms on roads, which would help the roads become ice and snow free in winters. Also other applications which require ice melting could benefit from our bacterium.\"",

This speeds up the cloning procedure at least three times and allows cloning of toxic genes. We make sure that no bacteria get harmed during our project. Moreover we have measured the RBS parts with various fluorescent proteins and they are not as standard as we would like them to be. The strength of a RBS part depends on the protein used. Why? Because the beginning of the protein influences the mRNA fold. We came up with the idea of RBS parts fused with short 'protein beginnings' -  expression adapters. Using genetic algorithm we designed expression adapters that would provide standardized protein expression or increase expression of your favorite protein. We are testing our design in the wet lab.",

This year's ArtScienceBangalore project proposes alternate  re-appropriations of the BioBrick by using existing BioBrick primers as random-PCR primers in investigating soil samples. This random PCR will provide a succinct signature of the biological diversity present in these samples. These investigations of soil lead us to ask questions about citizen's science 'performed' by non-institutional actors using accessible tools as well as gives us a glimpse into the 'post-natural world' where BioBricks may end up in our environment and may very well show up as bands in a gel. By imagining a world in which the Biobrick has become the accepted standard for synthetic biology, and where these engineered products are ubiquitous in our lives and environments, the samples we archive will serve as the baseline from which the subsequent extent of human influence can be measured.",

Researchers found a vertical oxygen gradient establishes in the biofilm. Such property allows us to use oxygen sensitive promoters to artificially induce differentiated functions through the spatial distribution of cells. Thus, the multi-step reaction can be processed within the different layers of the biofilm.The biofilm and its layered structure form spontaneously. Also biofilm has the natural resistance to high levels of toxin. These two properties render the Rainbofilm a convenient stable system for bio-production and bio-sensor. The system can cater to different needs simply by changing downstream genes. One possible application is ethanol production. The cellulose is degraded to monose from the bottom to the middle layer, and the ethanol is produced and secreted in the surface to minimize the toxicity to the inner cells.",

        "abstract": "'Essencia coli' is a vanillin producing bacterium equipped with a control system that keeps the concentration of vanillin at a constant level. The showpiece of the project is the feedback mechanism. Vanillin synthesis is initiated by irradiation with blue light. The preferred concentration can be modulated using the intensity of that light. At the same time the bacterium measures the amount of vanillin outside the cell and controls its production to maintain the set point. The designed system is universal in nature and has therefore potential benefits in different areas. The concept can easily be applied to other flavours and odours. In fact, any application that requires a constant concentration of a molecular substance is possible.",

We studied the rho-independent transcription terminators using both theoretical modeling and experiment method. We first developed a theoretical model. This model calculate the free energy of RNA folding and can predict the secondary structure of terminators. From the secondary structure, we  proposed an algorithm that can calculate terminator efficiency. In the aspect of experiment, we construct 100 terminators. We measure the the terminator efficiency by measuring the GFP and RFP which are placed before and after terminators. The efficiency calculated from theoretical model fit quite well with experimental results.  We also created a software and a web surver  for people to calculate their terminators and also built a database of terminator efficiency which we believe to be the largest database of such kind. Our work is by far the most comprehensive study on terminator efficiency.",

Therefore, we have attempted to build a viable system for the delivery of RNAi into breast cancer cells. First, we inserted a shRNA sequence coding for the Raf-1 protein into an AAV cassette containing two ITR's, allowing it to reproduce itself in mammalian cells. This cassette was inserted into our chosen vector, the filamentous bacteriophage FUSE-55. An antibody sequence was then added to the phage plasmid near the coat protein sequence in order to target HER2. As an additional feature, we have fused Silicatein and Silintaphin to mStrepavidin, which will bind to a protein tag in the coat, forming silicate structures on the coat of the phage, thereby reducing the immunotoxicity of the bacteriophage in vivo.",

The first involves secretion of the plant growth factor indole 3-acetic acid (auxin). This plant hormone will promote root growth which is essential for anchoring soil. The second module rewires the chemotactic mobility of the cell by introducing a novel receptor protein which is sensitive to root exudates. The bacteria can then be naturally taken up by root cells for targeted auxin delivery. The final module uses a toxin-antitoxin system to prevent horizontal gene transfer. While the plasmid containing the AuxIn system can be maintained inside our chassis, it will induce lysis in any other bacteria.By improving root growth, the AuxIn system provides a synthetic biology approach to tackling worldwide problems such as soil erosion and desertification. \"",

The minimal genome can be designed depending on characteristics of species by inserting the function of genes into particular locations.\r\n\r\nWith the second tool, brick-designer, user can design new bio-bricks.\r\nIt is also able to synthesize bricks by using the bricks registered in partsregistry. User can also utilize bricks he just designed. We tried to enhance software potability by enabling the bricks to save as Genbank and SBOL types.

Each of these activities requires software tools. Tools give users access to data as well as provide algorithmic support and abstraction to design large scale systems. We have created three software tools for these tasks. The first is a domain specific language called Eugene for the specification of biological constructs and rules for their creation. The second contribution is a visual design environment for device creation called Spectacles. Finally, we have created workflows for the Kepler design environment. This work is integrated within the Clotho design framework. We show that together they offer a powerful solution to the problems of today while also providing a path to the more exotic design activities of the future.",

With the development of the dairy industry in China, yogurt has become highly accepted by consumers, including those lactose intolerance people. And postacidification has always been the most vital factor which affects the shelf life and flavor of yogurt. So our team takes it as our track. Through the literature, we have discovered a gene, called lacR, which could combine with the lactose operon to inhibit the production of lactic acid in Bulgaria Lactobacillus. If lacR could be highly transcripted in Bulgaria Lactobacillus when the pH value of yogurt declines to a certain level, the acidification of yogurt would be postponed. Meanwhile, we also want to transfer part of human collagen genes to Streptococcus Thermophilus in order to enhance the nutrition of yogurt.\"",

Our aim is to engineer a novel, reversible molecular 'light switch' within E. coli by introducing a photoreceptor from non-photosynthetic bacteria (Deinococcus radiodurans and Agrobacterium tumafaciens). By cloning the bacteriophytochrome coupled with heme- oxygenase, an enzyme producing biliverdin, the created colonies are able to respond to red and far-red light environments. This novel approach will result in the colour of E. coli to 'switch' from blue to green reversibly. Our E. coli chameleon will serve as a fundamental 'bio-brick' for future applications by providing a simple and photo-reversible switch.",

Last year, the BYU iGEM team genetically engineered E. coli to detect heat or ROS. This year we developed E. coli capable of simultaneously sensing lactate, heat and ROS, implemented a novel Cre-Lox system, and constructed a library of thermosensors.  Our project uses two circuits, each with a unique reporter.  The first circuit contains a RNA thermosensor driven by a ROS-inducible promoter, allowing expression of Cre recombinase when both heat and ROS are present.  Although heat is transient, Cre ensures continued expression of the first reporter gene.  The second circuit contains a periplasmic lactate sensor coupled to a second reporter.  Finally, we have evolved a library of thermosensors that work in a narrow physiological range.  Together, this two-circuit system may allow accurate and specific detection of early colon cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "As a part of the iGEM competition, we decided to develop a new process, allowing the protection of the active biological principle. This type of process exists already, and it is called a vector. It may be biological as viruses, or chemicals as polymeric nanoparticles. Whatsoever its nature, the vector encounters many problems : Stability, targeting, membrane passage, and the immune response. Therefore, we tried to achieve the ideal vector, being the most stable as possible, can easily penetrate its targets, and outwit the immune system. We have created a double vectorization system, by using jointly a bacteria and a phage. The first vector which is bacterial, will target the tissue, and resist to the immune system. The second vector is a phage, will be used for cell targeting and  membrane penetration.  The combination of the two systems improves the intrinsic abilities of vectors, and offers new possibilities for applications.",

We are building a software environment enabling multiple distributed users to analyze and construct genetic parts and ultimately genomes with real-time communication. Our current version demonstrates the principle use as well as the power of the underlying Google Wave protocol for collaborative synthetic biology efforts. Many wave-robots with a manageable set of capabilities will divide and conquer the complex task of creating a genome in silico. The initial developments of 'SynBioWave' lay the ground for basic layout, calling and data exchange of wave-robots in a clear and open process, so that future robots can be added and shared easily",

It is a promising tool for engineering optical regulation of cellular behavior. Unlike most stimuli, light signals have the advantage of being highly precise with regards to temporal and spatial action as well as having readily tunable intensity. Within cells, a variety of effectors can be controlled using light, including DNA binding proteins, enzymes and mediators in signal transduction. Specifically, our projects focus on building light-responsive biobricks for control of mammalian cells by fusing photo-switchable domains found in plant, algal and fungal light sensing proteins to such effectors. Mammalian biochemistry is complex and well regulated, necessitating synthetic effectors that can be easily and dynamically adjusted to meet the needs of the application. Photo-switchable systems provide this versatility.",

Approaching biofuel production by direct synthesis from sunlight has the potential to solve the problems that arise with the conventional fermentation of starches and sugars such as the direct competition of fuel feedstock with food crops. Thus the Uppsala iGEM Team 2009 investigated the production of ethanol and butanol with the use of the cyanobacteria Synechocystis sp PCC6803. Also known as blue-green algae, cyanobacteria possess the ability to directly convert sunlight into biofuels. We engineered constructs for ethanol and butanol production as well as strategies to increase the yields of photosynthetic ethanol production.",

Through spills and improper disposal, toluene can contaminate soil and ground water environments.  Using microorganisms to clean up toluene-contaminated sites can be an effective and economical way of degrading the pollution before it can spread throughout the environment. There is concern, however, that these non-native microorganisms may upset the balance of the ecosystem through unnatural competition or horizontal synthetic gene transfer. We are engineering the Toluene Terminator as a way to neutralize toluene pollution while addressing these concerns. It will have the capabilities of sensing and mineralizing the toluene into carbon dioxide and water, but this terminator will not be back. The Toluene Terminator will have a suicide mechanism which kills the bacteria in the absence of toluene.",

Especially the use of synthetic estrogen in birth control pills results in increasing the concentrations of this disruptor in wastewater. Therefore, \"iGEM Team Bielefeld\" is developing a biological filter using immobilized laccases, enzymes able to radicalize and break down a broad range of aromatic substances. For the production of laccases from different bacteria, fungi and plants, two expression systems are used: \"Escherichia coli\" and the yeast \"Pichia pastoris\". Immobilization is carried out either by using cpc-silica beads or by fusing the enzymes to cellulose binding domains. The concept could be extended to other toxic pollutants in drinking and wastewater, as well as to industrial applications in paper and textile industries or even for bioremediation of contaminated soil.",

Synthetic biology and iGEM have long?attempted to refine this process of 'bridge-building'. The 2010 University of Edinburgh team has applied this idea comprehensively throughout their project. The BRIDGE protocol (BioBrick Recombineering In Direct Genome Editing) is a protocol for markerless insertion of BioBricks onto the bacterial chromosome, which will bridge ideas and reality in synthetic biology. Bacterial BRIDGEs aim to foster non-chemical means of communication between bacteria by pairing light-producing and light-sensing BioBricks; future teams may make use of them in a variety of novel applications. Finally, human BRIDGEs examine synthetic biology as ways of thinking and the permeation of human aspects, bridging the so-called 'divides' between disciplines and individuals. The question is... how do you think?",

In the industrial sector, cyanide is used to produce paper, paints, textiles, plastics and in the mining industry as a way to recover metals. In this project, we will incorporate genes that will allow the bacteria to become a biosensor with the capacity to detect the presence of cyanide and cyanide compounds by adding the expression of cyanide resistant genes (cioAB) and a reporter gene under the control of an inducible promoter. This new technique will also become a platform so that in the future we could incorporate a gene that allows the bacteria, not only detect, but also to degrade these compounds using a method that is accessible and environmentally friendly through bioremediation.",

However, most publicly available parts (including those in the Registry) remain largely uncharacterized. Therefore, we propose a minimal measurement standard for the quantitative characterization of one of the most frequently used parts, promoters. This approach uses both mRNA and protein measurements to provide a tractable and universal analysis of relevant promoter characteristics. In an effort to elucidate promoter design principles, we have also designed and characterized new promoter and enhancer sequences. Our goal is to contribute to the advancement of fundamental synthetic biology by evaluating the performance of new and existing promoters and enhancers, which may serve as a model for describing other basic parts such as ribosome binding sites and transcriptional terminators.",

Synthetic Biology can revolutionize space exploration and settlement by providing a microbial platform for catalyzing critical reactions and manufacturing essential products. Biological devices have a major advantage over classical machines: the ability to self-replicate and regenerate.Project RegoBrick uses bacteria to cement Martian and Lunar regolith simulant into a concrete-like compound. Extraterrestrial settlements will be able to use such a process to build structures using resources readily available in the environment, instead of having to transport materials from Earth.Project PowerCell develops a universal energy source from engineered cyanobacteria, which generate carbon and nitrogenous nutrients from sunlight and air and secrete them to sustain other microbes. This system will allow future settlers to transform resources on other planets into fuel, food, drugs, and other useful products.\"",

We are developing low-cost alternatives to existing hardware and enzymes in an attempt to expand participation in biological research and development.  Our project expands the accessibility of Taq Polymerase by engineering it in a form compatible with BioBrick assembly.   This allows use of the over-expressed enzyme from a crude bacterial extract in a PCR reaction at a fraction of the cost of highly purified commercial enzyme.   In addition, we have developed inexpensive and easily assembled lab equipment such as a gel electrophoresis apparatus and a PCR thermal cycler.   Enabling researchers to synthesize their own enzymes and having access to inexpensive tools will allow for increased participation among the DIY-bio community, stretch increasingly scarce educational funds, and allow rapid scale up of large scale gene synthesis projects.",

By using E. coli, we engineered and devised a prototype, dubbed E. cryptor, for 1) bio-encryption and -decryption with error checking; and 2) data storage in a bacterial system.  In the age of synthetic biology, designed microorganisms may carry a specific DNA barcode to be distinguished from their natural counterparts.  Our system could turn such barcode into more than simply a tag.  In the future, can we also store text, pictures, and even videos into these tiny bacteria and protect the contents?",

In this approach, biological design guides both experiments and mathematical modeling, but is it possible to use experimental data to reversely engineer the mathematical model and guide backwards the biological design? This project answers the question. We use reverse engineering techniques to get mathematical models such as ordinary differential equations(ODEs), directly from the experimental data and build the feasible designs according to the models. In this sense, we not only fully connect biology, experiments and mathematics, but also get feasible designs that have certain behaviors. To realize this idea, we build a suite of applications that provide researchers with efficient workflows.",

Once the Lactobacillus acidophilus has reached the duodenum, they will lyse by either by a timed inducible/repressible system, a bile-inducible system, or an encryption system. Using DNA we can mimic the functionality of a combination lock, and produce a 'locked' gene, which can be effectively 'unlocked' only after a specific sequence of inputs. Since DNA functions as a logical medium, the 'locked' and 'unlocked' states are heritable, which makes this system useful as the computational basis for many higher-order genetic devices from bacterial calculators to engineering of new metabolic pathways to bacterial drug delivery systems.",

This year, we WHU-China team engineered a probiotics “E. coslim” from Escherichia coli, hoping to provide a new approach for treating obesity. Specifically, three genetic devices were designed. The first two devices were assembled to sense and response to fatty acids and glucose. To achieve these goals, promoters repressed by FadR and CRP were devised and synthesized respectively. When functional genes are placed downstream of these promoters appropriately, the two devices are supposed to degrade fatty acids and convert glucose into cellulose rapidly, thus preventing excessive calorie intake as well as producing prebiotics. Meanwhile, the third device was designed to control the densities of “E. coslim” and forestall horizontal gene transfer in future applications. As a whole, by simulating, we are developing “E. coslim” to regulate the microbiome composition in intestine to reduce risks of obesity.",

In this project we aim to control, over time and space, the production of proteins tagged with a silver-binding peptide for in situ silver nanoparticle nucleation inside microdroplets generated by microfluidic devices. Combining a transcription-translation system with protein coding genes and a recombination logic inside microdroplets provides spatial control. Moreover, in the microfluidic chamber we can pinpoint the beginning of synthesis, and easily track and isolate the droplets. Site-specific recombination generates a molecular timer for temporal control of protein synthesis. Unlike transcriptional regulation, this method gives true all-or-none induction due to covalent modification of DNA by Flp recombinase. Determining the transfer curve of inter-FRT site distance versus average recombination time allows the onset of gene expression to be predicted. We then apply this Flp reporter system as a powerful PoPS measurement device.",

Different combination of such E.coli could therefore achieve the effect of neon lights.Part III: dinner serviceThe genetically modified bacteria involve a certain self-feedback system. When the 'customer' is starving, it orders dinner from the 'chef'; and the chef serves meals. While the 'customer' is full, it tells the 'chef' that no more food is wanted, so the 'chef' stops cooking.",

E.coli populations communicate bi-directionally by a class of signaling molecules involves in bacteria quorum sensing, that is, N-Acyl homoserine lactones (AHL), to regulate the gene expression of each other. By engineering their gene circuits, two groups (we call them CELL-A and CELL-B) will form a network, with B inducing A and A restricting B, thus cycle in a homochronous way. We have established a mechanism to change the rate of the AHL expression, allowing us to control the period and the phase of the oscillatory cycle. Moreover, a mathematical model has been made to analyze the dynamics of the system, and computer simulation software is introduced into the process.\"",

Firedamp is a flammable gas found in coal mines and it mainly contains methane. Beside its explosive property, methane is also the main contributor to global warming. However, recent mechanisms in mines release the methane that is collected into air. By offers of Synthetic biology, we aimed to design a device which will work on E.coli that provides solutions for side effects of methane. Device that we are planning to construct involves the genes of bacteria (Methylococcus capsulatus) and insect (Drosophilia melanogaster) Our compact system in E.coli is fabricated as sensation of methane, the conversion of methane to methanol and then entrapment of methanol to handle for biofuel and death of bacteria at 42 C by kill switch mechanism.\"",

Our team developed a design to address this problem using the resiliant spore-forming bacterium Bacillus subtilis. We engineered B. subtilis to sense and sequester cadmium from the environment into metallothionein containing spores, rendering it bio-unavailable. Germination of the spores can be disabled, making retrieval of the cadmium unnecessary since they can persist intact for thousands of years. We computationally simulated the life cycles of individual cells and entire cell populations, to estimate the parameter values necessary to maintain sustainable populations of sporulating, germinating and vegetative cells. Our design required us to engineer  stochastic differentiation processes at a single cell level. A sporulation rate tuner was developed and  we also engineered a tuneable stochastic invertase switch to stochastically control cell differention and fate.",

At present, engineering these properties is challenging due in large part to the inherent throughput limitation imposed by microscopy. We have developed a strategy that enables high-throughput library screening with microscopy by coupling a unique fluorescence signature with each genotype present in a library. These MiCodes (microscopy barcodes) are generated by targeting combinations of fluorophores to several organelles within yeast, and they eliminate the need to isolate and observe clonal populations separately. MiCodes can potentially scale to library sizes of 10^6 or more, and their analysis can be largely automated using existing image processing software. As a proof of principle, we applied MiCodes to the problem of finding unique pairs of protein-protein interaction parts.",

Current methods for purification from cellular lysate are expensive and time consuming. Biofactory utilizes modified enzymes, capable of being attached to surfaces, in the creation of a modular microfluidic chip for each enzyme. The surface bonding is performed by the well characterized biotin-avidin mechanism. When combined in series, these chips operate as a linear biochemical pathway for continous flow reactions. Additionally, we engineered E. Coli with the mechanism for light-induced apoptosis to easily lyse cultures producing the necessary enzymes. The resulting lysate is flowed through the microfluidic channels, coating them with the desired enzyme. We believe these methods will reduce unwanted side reactions, and lower the costs of producing bio-pharmaceuticals in the future. \"",

Taking advantage of this, our project aims to build two genetic control systems based on R. sphaeroides photosynthesis cluster regulation. The first one is a light dependent system controlled by two proteins AppA/PpsR that works like an antirepresor/repressor mechanism, and the second one is an oxygen dependent system of two-component called PrrA/PrrB. This two devices were tested on R. palustris chassis, using a cassete in which a reporter (GFP) is regulated by external conditions that activate or repress its expresion. Once we have characterized the functionality of these networks, our perspective is to develop a Rhodofactory, it means to control the produccion of differents metabolites, such as biodiesel and butanol, using simple signals.",

T3SS is a syringe like organelle found in bacterium such as Salmonella which uses it to inject virulence effector proteins into a target eukaryotic cell.  We think this system can be applied to direct reprogramming of somatic cells among many other things.  We tested T3SS performance and tried to make it more convenient. For this purpose we designed a plasmid backbone which can instantly produce ready-to-inject fusion proteins from ordinary biobrick part. Using it, we tried to further characterise this system by injecting a library of protein domains.  In Science Gallery we exhibited awesome photographs related with biotechnology in public. We tried to catch the pedestrians' interest in current synthetic biology and explore their thoughts.",

Traditional cellular communication has relied since time immemorial on chemical messengers to exchange information. Regardless of their scope, these messengers are constrained to a system; eg: even far reaching couriers such as hormones are bound within the chemical structure that is the human body. But this is about to change. In this project, our goal is to render the chemical barrier deprecated by using a non-chemical herald: photons. These will transport information between our engineered cells, creating a photon-based inter-cellular communication system. These messengers are produced through bio-luminescent reactions, and are quite capable of traversing multiple environments. This enables the transmission of information beyond the chemical, biological, and even spatial limitations. As the courier is effectively decoupled from the chemical layer, it is an innovative step in establishing communications between organic-based and silicon-based systems, such as computers.",

Getting close to pathogens, it sends the killer gene to them with conjugation. Then pathogens will be killed. To accomplish this project, we planned to add three functions to E.coli. First, expression of the mutant H-NS proteins enables E.coli to move faster. This contributes to increasing the frequency of conjugation. Second function is new taxis for AHL. We make the target bacteria as a model of pathogens, and they produce AHL. BeE.coli goes for the area where high concentrations of AHL that means concentration of target bacteria. Last, BeE.coli kills pathogens by sending the killer gene with the conjugative plasmid. BeE.coli has the anti killer gene repressing the killer gene. In the future, BeE.coli will be useful for medical scenes. \"",

The ultimate goal is to build a micromachine sensing and determining of the concentration of heavy metals in a sample solution (e.g. the waste water). In order to design the system, we will employ two fluorescence proteins (GFP and RFP) and aryl acylamidase as signal reporters. Since each heavy metal promoter produces unique fluorescence or color by those reporters, if more than two heavy metals coexist in a solution, the results would be interpreted from the convoluted fluorescence and/or color rather than a single signal detection. The successful construction of the synthetic modules in E. coli can be utilized in the form of a lyophilized powder, which can be stored in a drug capsule to make it portable.",

        "abstract": "Polluted water is the world’s largest health risk, killing over three million people a year. Our project focused on enhancing biofilms used in water treatment. We designed a system to accelerate the adhesion of bacteria to surfaces. On biofilm aggregation, expression of silica-binding peptides works to build silica matrices on the surface of cells. These matrices act as a mechanical filter for large particles and a barrier between the biofilm and fluid shear, decreasing dislodgment of organisms that could otherwise lead to fouling. We envision these improved biofilms being used in municipal water treatment to help recycle and filter home waste water streams, a concept we implemented in lab-scale membrane bioreactors. Bringing awareness of synthetic biology closer to our community, we initiated a community bio-lab and a Girl Scout biotechnology badge. Ultimately, we hope to take synthetic biology from benchtop to park bench.",

OMV technology presents an affordable, non-toxic, and direct method of drug delivery and antigen tracking. We have designed a method for visualizing the interactions of mammalian cells with outer membrane vesicles by utilizing the ClyA surface protein as an attachment site for fluorescent proteins.  The current goal of this project is to characterize the distribution of varying ClyA-fluorescent protein complexes on OMVs.  Future work will be to develop a tracking system employing a ClyA-fluorescent protein construct for in vitro microscope imaging. An antibody fragment will also be attached to another ClyA complex, allowing the OMV tracking system to target specific regions of an organism. This method allows in vitro characterization of OMVs and provides integral data for developing a future OMV delivery platform in vivo.",

However, to achieve neuronal network stimulation, light cables are still needed, leaving long-standing annoying issues regarding immune responses unresolved. This year NYMU-Taipei iGEM team creates wireless neuro-stimulator, focusing on achieving remote neuro-stimulation to minimize the invasion and damage to the neuron. To achieve this goal, we use a species of magnetic bacteria, Magnetospirillum magneticum AMB-1. We have chosen mms13, a transmembrane protein as our target for protein design, as it serves as a linker between reception of wireless magnetic field and optogenetic neuro-stimulation output. Regarding the neuroimmune response, we choose three genes to achieve symbiosis within glial cell: MinC, a division inhibitor, INV, a gene for invasion and LLO, a gene for facilitated escape from phagosomes. Overall, our project will make optogenetic neuro-stimulation wireless and safe.\"",

The proteins, such as extracellular pilin, MacA, and many other cytochromes, which E. coli does not have were isolated from Geobacter sulfurreducens and introduced into E. coli to formulate the most optimal pathway for generating electromotive force in a microbial fuel cell apparatus.  Some problems were faced concerning plasmid engineering and the simple fact that Geobacter is anaerobic and E. coli is aerobic. The current work includes production and optimization of a microbial fuel cell into which our modified bacteria will be placed.",

Our E.coli chassis progresses through a series of defined stages culminating in the production of a safe, inanimate pill. This sequential process involves drug production, self-encapsulation in a protective coating and genome deletion. The temporal transition through each of these stages has been individually optimised by both media and temperature. The E.ncapsulator provides an innovative method to deliver any biologically synthesisable compound and bypasses the need for expensive storage, packaging and purification processes. The E.ncapsulator is an attractive candidate for commercial pill development and demonstrates the massive manufacturing potential in Synthetic Biology.",

Microbial enhanced oil recovery (MEOR) has been utilized across the world to increase the productivity of these difficult resources. Using a synthetic biology approach, we have designed the CAB (CO2, acetic acid, biosurfactant) extraction method for a modified MEOR to extract carbonate oil deposits. CAB extraction will utilize natural carbon fixation machinery in the cyanobacteria Synechococcus elongatus to convert CO2 into sugars to fuel acetic acid and biosurfactant production in Escherichia coli. Acetic acid and biosurfactant applied to carbonate rock will facilitate and enhance extraction. The use of carbon fixation to feed downstream systems can be tailored for many applications requiring inexpensive methods for fueling biological systems, while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. CAB extraction provides an alternative, inexpensive, and environmentally sustainable MEOR method for carbonate oil deposits.",

Both are based on pattern, arrangement and direction data of genes from DEG and NCBI with statistical analyzing.\"",

We created a green light-activated actuator to respond to external light signals, as well as a riboregulator-based signal counter to count the number of flashes. In ESCAPES, the first green light flash induces the E. coli to self-aggregate, while the second flash causes them to auto-lyse, thus greatly simplifying the protein preparation process. The light-activated actuator was constructed by fusing the light responsive domain of the Synechocystis photoreceptor CcaS with the EnvZ histidine kinase domain. Self-aggregation is achieved by the induction of the Antigen43 gene, which we isolated from E. coli, while autolysis took advantage of the available BioBrick parts endolysin and holin. ESCAPES helps you “escape” from tedious protein preparation steps, such as centrifugation and cell disruption.",

We have designed a proof-of-concept for chromosome-building that will use the site-specific integrase of phage ?C31 to integrate a BioBrick into a defined locus of the E. coli genome. Six pairs of integrase-targeted att sites have been designed to be non-cross-reactive in order to support repeatable cassette-exchange reactions for chromosome building. We have also written software to model the integrase-mediated rearrangement of DNA molecules containing att sites, to aid the design of more elaborate chromosome-building systems. To selectively degrade the native chromosome we designed a nuclease-based, inducible genome-degradation system. In its simplest form, our system can be used to integrate biological devices into a chromosome in situations requiring stable copy number and selection-free maintenance.",

This system has many potential uses, such as the creation of precise nano-structures or biomemetic bone. The coliroid light-inducible system was assembled by cloning a fusion protein of Cph1 and EnvZ, called Cph8, from a previous iGEM group, and isolating and cloning the two other genes (Heme Oxigenase and PcyA) required for functionality of the system and putting all the parts into a vector. Then the silicatein alpha gene isolated from Subterities domuncula was fused with E. coli outer membrane protein A (OmpA) and ice nucleation protein (INP) and inserted in the vector under control of the coliroid system.\"",

Specifically, we thought “wouldn’t it be nice to be able to leave a plate out in the field, collect it a day or two later, and be able to tell at what time the synthesis of the reporter molecules was triggered?” Ideally, protein reporters would leave the cell and diffuse through the agar, leaving a clear history of their expression. To this end, we are 1) creating a library of Sec and Tat leader sequence biobricks for directing expressed proteins to the periplasm, 2) making an E. coli expression strain with a weakened outer cell wall that leaks most of the periplasmic proteins to the environment, and 3) measuring and modeling the diffusion of small molecules and proteins in agar to ascertain the ability to derive the times and conditions under which they originated.",

We have two systems that correspond the game ³Rock, Paper, Scissors² (RPS) and to Conway¹s ³Game of Life² (GoL). In GoL expression/diffusion of lactones is exploited to create local rules that modulate expression of a fluorescent protein. Fluorescence patterns for different combinations of conditions are modelled using a new simulation tool designed to be generically applicable to inter-bacterial communication. In the RPS system three 'species' each produce a different fluorescent protein whose expression is downregulated by a lactone from one of the other 'species' and hence the interaction network is intransitive. Simulations indicate that when this game is played out on culture plates, a range of complex patterns evolve with time. Also, selective patterning of the different 'species' allows for new 'racetrack' or 'playing field' type of interactivity.",

To solve this problem, the aim of our project is to engineer strains of the industrial workhorses E. coli and S. cerevisiae to recognize and destroy contaminants. The engineered yeast will recognize lactic acid bacteria contaminants, which greatly affect Brazilian´s ethanol production. The presence of lactic acid will activate a lysozyme-based killing mechanism, effective against gram-positive contamination. The engineered E. coli will recognize contaminants based on a non-self recognition mechanism and a percentage of the population will differentiate into a killing lineage releasing colicins and endonucleases. The killing mechanisms will be regulated by promoter Py, probably activated by conjugation. The characterization of Py and a lactate-inducible promoter that is not subjected to glucose catabolic repression are the main challenges of our project.",

Gram-negative bacteria naturally produce outer member vesicles (OMVs): spherical, bilayered proteolipids from 20-200nm in diameter. OMVs carry outer membrane, periplasmic and cytoplasmic proteins, DNA, RNA and other biological molecules. They protect their cargo from the extracellular environment and deliver it to a multitude of target cells via membrane fusion. We investigate the possibility of allowing the secretion of any protein in OMVs via fusion with novel, non-toxic partners enhanced in OMVs, using a novel Bioscaffold compatible with the current assembly standard. A new version of the award winning BSim software has been developed to study applications at the population level such as communication. The ultimate goal is to create a safe and standardised system for directed delivery of proteins into cells.",

Yet, constraints of limited sequence length and variation recognized by available restriction enzymes pose a major roadblock for synthetic biology. We developed the basis for universal restriction enzymes, primarily for routine cloning but also with potential for in-vivo applications. We use a nucleotide cleavage domain fused to a binding domain, which recognizes a programmable adapter that mediates DNA binding and thus cleavage. As adapter we use readily available modified oligonucleotides, as binding domain anticalins, and as cleavage domain FokI moieties engineered for heterodimerization and activity. For application, this universal enzyme has merely to be mixed with the sequence-specific oligonucleotide and the target DNA. Binding and release are addressed by thermocycling. We provide concepts for in-vivo applications by external adapter delivery and activity regulation by photo switching. Additionally, an argonaute protein is engineered towards a DNA endonuclease.",

The end goal of our project was to create spatial color patterns using bacteria, such as a color wheel and a rainbow, that required control over several color outputs in response to spatial gradients of chemical inducers. Colour gradients were achieved using a high-copy plasmid that contained both an inducible colour gene and its corresponding repressor. Colour banding was achieved by a novel means of adjusting gene expression through plasmid copy number control that varied from 0 to ~1000 copies/cell as a function of inducer concentration. Note that the rapid loss of plasmid that occurs in the absence of inducer also constitutes a novel and extremely effective safety switch for genetically engineered organisms which might enter the environment.",

To remedy this problem the 2010 Washington University iGEM team has introduced a synthetic alternative splicing tool, as well as designed and produced new BioBricks parts to ease transformation of synthetic constructs into S. cerevisiae. A mutually exclusive exon splicing system was formulated in which Sex-lethal interacts with the native splicing machinery to affect splice site choice. Two vectors have been designed to facilitate simple bacterial BioBrick manipulation and subsequent chromosomal integration into the yeast genome. A yeast positive selection marker BioBrick has been produced for the first time. Chromosomal integration with positive selection will stabilize and streamline BioBrick transformations into S. cerevisiae. A synthetic splicing assembly will allow for new synthetic biology techniques such as isoform engineering of proteins or combinatorial logic.",

The emphasis of our project is put on this latter, 'systems' aspect of iGEM. More precisely, we aim at the development and experimental demonstration of a scalable approach for the realization of logical functions in vivo. By developing a computational biological network based on RNA logical devices we will offer everyone the opportunity to 'program' their own cells with individual AND/OR/NOT connections between BioBricks of their choice. Thereby, BioBricks can finally fulfill their original assignment as biological parts that can be connected in many different ways. We will achieve this by engineering simple and easy-to-handle switches based on predictable RNA/RNA-interactions regulating transcriptional termination. These switches represent a complete set of logical functions and are capable of forming arbitrarily complex networks.",

Biofilms commonly cause complications in both industrial and medical settings and represent a significant source of morbidity and mortality. A synthetic biology approach to tackling biofilms has only recently been applied to Escherichia coli biofilms. To eliminate the more clinically relevant Staphylococcus aureus biofilms, our team aims to break new ground at iGEM by using S. aureus as a model host and developing a standard for genetically engineering bacteriophages. Our design incorporates DspB, a biofilm matrix-degrading enzyme into the _13 phage genome, which is altered to operate under the regulation of the S. aureus agr quorum sensing pathway and thus upon contact with biofilms. As a complement, we have also developed a mathematical model that simulates the dynamics of our system under different conditions.",

        "abstract": "A clear understanding of stem cell differentiation pathways is important to advance regenerative medicine therapies using stem cells. An incomplete knowledge base of developmental mechanisms impedes stem cell research and innovation. The iDifferentiate system is a genetic engineering platform that may be used to elucidate differentiation pathways of any cell type for which there is a known lineage-specific cis-regulatory element. To demonstrate this system we developed the SAVE Assay, which uses visual cues to indicate the overall quantity and relative percentage of atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes amongst differentiated stem cells. The assay uses a dual plasmid system that selects for successfully transformed stem cells via neomycin and puromycin resistance along with fluorescent reporter genes regulated by atrial and ventricular promoters. Altering the basic protocol by using different reagents and induction factors will allow scientists to quickly and accurately determine differentiation pathways of two or more related cell types.",

        "abstract": "Photosynthetic light harvesting antennas function to collect light and transfer energy to a reaction center for photochemistry. Phototrophs evolved large antennas to compete for photons in natural environments where light is scarce.  Consequently, cells at the surface of photobioreactors over-absorb light, leading to attenuated photobioreactor light penetration and starving cells on the interior of photons. This reduction of photosynthetic productivity has been identified as the primary impediment to improving photobioreactor efficiency.  While reduction of antenna size improves photosynthetic productivity, current approaches to this end uniformly truncate antennas and are difficult to manipulate from the perspective of bioengineering. We aim to create a modifiable system to optimize antenna size throughout the bioreactor by utilizing a synthetic regulatory mechanism that correlates expression of the pucB/A LH2 antenna genes with incident light intensity. This new application of synthetic biology serves to transform the science of antenna reduction into the engineering of antenna optimization.",

        "abstract": "Commercial Liquid Handling Systems are extremely expensive, and are typically beyond the reach of the average molecular biologist interested in performing high throughput methods.  To address this problem, our project consists of the design and implementation of a liquid handling system built from commonly accessible Legos.  We demonstrate a proof-of-principle use for this system to perform BioBrick assembly by transferring colored dye solutions on a 96-well plate.  We introduce a new concept called LegoRoboBrick.  The liquid handling system is build by designing and implementing 3 LegoRoboBrick modular components: ALPHA (Automated Lego Pipette Head Assembly), BETA (BioBrick Environmental Testing Apparatus), and PHI (Pneumatic Handling Interface).  We will demonstrate that the same BioBrick assembly software can run on multiple plug-and-play LegoRoboBrick instances with different physical dimensions and geometric configurations. The modular design of LegoRoboBricks allows easy extension of new laboratory functionalities in the future.",

To achieve the goal, our design process is split up into three parts: Riboswitch, mRNA Binding, and SsrA. (1) Riboswitch - faster production of proteins by inducing the translation of pre-transcribed RNA molecules. (2) mRNA Binding - using mRNA aptamers and split GFP/RFP-eIF4A reporter systems to show faster promoter activity or the expression of mRNA transcripts. (3) SsrA - fast, specific, and constitutive proteolysis achieved by engineering fluorescent proteins with LVA tags.",

Although the assembly was successful, the resulting detector is leaky with measurable RFP even in conditions with no iron present. In our lab environment, we found that it was necessary to work with relatively high concentrations of bacteria and DNA. We developed simplified procedures for transformations, digests, and ligations, but we continue to face problems with DNA visualization and measuring the pigments from the bacteria.",

Through expression of heterologous genes, E. coli strains which appear to have a response to a specific biofuel were generated. However, these biosensors did not produce the low uninduced and high induced levels of expression desired. This situation appears to be common among biosensor-based iGEM projects. In order to improve the biofuel sensors, as well as provide a framework for other teams to do the same, a universal biosensor directed evolution construct was assembled. The device can be used to both select for high expression in the presence of an analyte, as well as select for no expression in its absence. In conjunction with mutagenesis of key genes, this device could be used to significantly improve existing and novel biosensors. \"",

        "abstract": "Whooping cough, the infectious respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, is diagnosed in tens of millions of people and results in almost 300,000 deaths globally each year. Low-income and unvaccinated individuals as well as infants are especially susceptible. Current diagnostic procedures are complicated, costly, and can take up to a week, by which time the disease may have progressed or spread. The enormous impact of this disease urgently motivates the development of a faster, cheaper, and more reliable diagnostic test. Our epidemiology models suggest that earlier diagnosis could drastically reduce the incidence and impact of the disease. We propose an engineered bacteriophage diagnostic system for rapid clinical detection of pertussis. We first engineered T7 bacteriophage to demonstrate this approach in E. coli. Our modular diagnostic approach can be applied to the high-sensitivity detection of other bacteria.",

        "abstract": "Oxygen contamination can be a challenge for many anaerobic processes.  To monitor these processes we created and oxygen bio-sensor in E. coli which produces an anaerobic fluorescent protein.  The task of creating an oxygen bio-sensor is compounded by the fact that oxygen diffusion through many substances is very limited; so oxygen contamination can be undetected due to a response which is too 'soft' . To combat this, we enabled our sensor to induce this response in non-oxygenated bacteria via the lux system; thus amplifying the signal and producing a bio-alarm which is sufficiently 'loud' to not be missed.  To accomplish this goal we characterized the response characteristics of the many different Lux components in the parts-distribution.  This system can be easily inverted to monitor oxygen depletion in oxygen dependent processes.",

To accomplish this, we are constructing chimeric quorum sensing receptors that can localize on Lactobacillus membrane and detect autoinducing peptides (AIPs) released by S. aureus. The ligand binding to the chimeric receptor will trigger downstream plnABCD pathway and initiate the synthesis and secretion of RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP), a heptapeptide with proven effectiveness in attenuating S. aureus virulence. The possibility of achieving this lies in the structural homology of the catalytic domain of the quorum sensing receptors in Lactobacillus and S. aureus. Both receptors belong to the HPK10 subfamily of a two-component histidine kinase family. Attenuation of S. aureus virulence by quorum-sensing inhibitors should not yield a strong selective pressure for development of resistance, and would therefore be an attractive concept for preventive medicine.",

The iGEM Team Heidelberg 2010 unlocks the world of synthetic microRNAs, since focusing solely on DNA has often been inconvenient for medical purposes. We engineered a toolkit for standardized measurements of interactions between artificial miRNAs and their binding sites. From this data we were able to compute an in silico model integrating binding site properties and knockdown percentages. Thus, the expression level of any gene of choice could be arbitrarily adjusted by employing the corresponding binding site design. To produce tissue specific miRNA gene shuttles, we developed an evolution-based method for synthesis of new adeno associated viruses. This enabled us to overcome the natural limitations of virus selectivity. In the future, miBricks could be applied for treatment of diseases like Diabetes and Hemophilia, opening the doors to new Synthetic Biology based medical approaches.",

Current methods to clean black crust are either too destructive or non-effective. The aim of our project is to develop a system to more gently restore statues and monuments. To achieve this goal, we engineered E. coli to eat the black crust. More specifically, we introduced an aerobic sulfate reducing pathway and a hydrogen sulfide producing pathway into E. coli. In this way, the sulfate component of the black crust is transformed into a gas, thereby degrading the offending substance without degrading the original material of the statue. In addition to our black crust project, we developed a ratiometric fluorescence platform to test transcriptional terminators and subsequently used the platform to compare the efficiencies of T7 and E. coli transcriptional terminators with T7 and E. coli RNA polymerases.",

The Pen is able to express more than four colors in various intensities with single bacterial culture. This will be achieved by constructing plasmids carrying genes coding for four different fluorescent proteins under the control of seven promoters having different sensitivity to oxidative stress.  The E. coli carrying these plasmids will produce different colors with various intensities by differentially responding to the gradient of hydrogen peroxide treatment.

Past iGEM projects have used chemical or optical stimuli to actuate transcriptional responses. Our project, however, seeks to add voltage sensitivity to Saccharomyces cerevisiae. Baker's yeast was chosen because in some sense yeast have a system that responds to voltage input. With a voltage stimulus one can open the voltage-gated calcium channels of yeast, causing calcium ions to rush into the cytoplasm. This causes calcineurin to dephosphorylate Crz1, which enters the nucleus and binds various promoters. Our group presents a library of characterized Crz1-sensitive promoters of both naturally-occurring and synthetic varieties. Genes downstream of these promoters are thus voltage-regulated in media containing calcium.",

We  achieved this by utilization of auto-inducing loops, that act as memory units, and an engineered riboregulator, acting as an AND gate. The design of the device is modular, allowing free change of both input and output signals. Each increase of the counter results in a different output signal. The design allows implementation of any number of memory units, as the AND gate design enables to extend the system in a hassle-free way. In order to tweak bistable autoinducing loops we need a very fast and robust method for characterizing parts. For this we have created a genetic algorithm that will enable us to find parameters of the parts used in the design. It also allows the combination of data from multiple experiments across models with overlapping components.\"",

Hence, we come up with two innovative ways which have great advantages over the traditional one.\r\nThe first one, we try to take advantage of the bacteria's nature selection system. We construct a new plasmid which contains two types of genes, sweet and fatal for bacteria. Regularly, the sweet genes will be expressed, promoting the spread of bacteria transfer plasmid through conjugation. Once the amount of bacteria reaches a certain threshold, the dead gene will turn on, resulting in the death of the host bacteria. \r\nThe second method derive from the idea of dog-eat-dog, we attempt to cultivate a Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus strain, which live in cracking other bacteria. We consider to improve the sterilization efficiency to a certain bacteria. \r\nAll the two methods may avoid the probability of bacteria resistance at the same time.",

Our team comprises of nine undergraduates, 3 graduate students as student mentor and two faculty mentors, one each from biology and engineering background. The project specifically deals with the analysis of effect of single and multiple feedback loops on gene expression. This project will involve theoretical and experimental studies. We have designed synthetic constructs to mimic multiple feedbacks.

However, 'chemical wires' that allow versatile concurrent communications are far from sufficient.Accordingly, our project intends to develop a versatile 'chemical wire' toolbox for both multicellular Boolean computing and non-Boolean dynamics by two approaches. Firstly, a set of recently reported novel quorum sensing systems have been characterized. Secondly, quorum sensing (QS) based transcriptional repression system have been built from the ground up by conversing LuxR family of transcription activators into repressors. We next sought to develop design rules of microbial consortia as supplements to this toolbox. To validate this toolbox together with the design rules, several robust combinational and sequential logic circuits that are difficult to be implemented in single cell have been constructed as a proof of concept for Boolean logic. As for non-Boolean dynamics, a balancer of microbial population density have been created with supporting microfluid device.",

The switch is based on the repressor-anti-repressor system of the salmonella phages Gifsy1 and Gifsy2 and the lambda-phage anti-termination system. The latest induced output will remain stable through generations, even once the input ceases, due to the phage regulatory systems. We present the framework for this development and characterize the regulatory mechanisms by using fluorescent proteins as the reporter (outputs). The dynamics of the system have been modeled and we have also attempted to characterize and submit the promoters, repressors and anti-repressors from the salmonella phages, as well as the two anti-terminator proteins from the lambda phage, as BioBricks. We have hereby demonstrated the engineering of a multipurpose bi-stable switch sensor/reporter tool that can have numerous applications.",

Here we use a synthetic biology approach to imitate heterochromatin in E.coli to achieve gene silencing. Specifically, fusion proteins comprising tetR and different parts of HNS (histone-like nucleoid structuring protein) were synthesized, they are expected to bind DNA specifically and carry out polymerization among the fusion HNS and the native HNS to create a densely packed DNA form, which may block the transcription. We produced constructs with tetO sites upstream or downstream of lac promoter and EGFP gene. Then we used standard constitutive promoters with different activity to drive our fusion proteins to find the optimum expression level. Moreover, tetR, HNS and fusion proteins were purified and gel shift assay was utilized to detect the interaction between those proteins with DNA. This study presents a novel approach to introduce a mimic heterochromatin-like structure into prokaryotes to achieve inducible gene silencing. \"",

These applications include artificial tendons and ligaments, biomedical sutures, athletic gear, parachute cords, air bags, and other yet discovered products which require a high tensile strength with amazing extendibility. Spiders however cannot be farmed because they are territorial and cannibalistic. Thus, an alternative to producing spider silk must be found. We aim to engineer spider silk genes into E. coli to produce this highly valuable product. Spider silk production in bacteria has been limited due to the highly repetitive nature of the spider silk amino acids in the protein. To overcome this obstacle we are using various synthetic biology techniques to boost spider silk protein production and increase cellular fitness. After successful production, spider silk protein is artificially spun into usable fibers and tested for physical properties.",

The EcoTanker takes up a target compound from the environment and delivers it to a desired location for easy harvesting. The target compound is taken up and stored inside the cell in an EcoTank, a bacterial microcompartment (pduABJKNU). Blue light then directs the delivery of the 'cargo' to a desired destination by phototaxis, using the N. pharaonis blue light responsive domain (NpSRII-NpHtrII-Tar) linked to an E. coli two component system. The EcoTankers are then signaled by green light to self-aggregate and autolyse in response to quorum sensing. We can then easily collect the EcoTanks filled with the target compound, which could be an environmentally toxic substance or an industrially desirable chemical. We expect that EcoTanker to be a powerful machine in various bioremediation and industrial applications.",

Heavy metal ions, such as Zn2+, Cd2+, and As2+, that are taken up by the cell will be trapped inside the tank by a metallothionein fused to a BMC-localizing tag. Using BMC in such a way will be very advantageous as it may achieve the accumulation of high concentrations of heavy metals in one place. The EcoLion that has stored heavy metals will be conveniently collected by light using phototaxis or self-aggregation. This EcoLion may ultimately be applied for collecting a number of different toxic or valuable molecules by using specific target-binding peptides or proteins.\"",

As a result, glucose accumulates to dangerous levels. High blood glucose concentrations can cause irreversible damage to critical organs, impairing their functionality. With parts from the iGEM registry, our team created a glucose-controlled promoter linked to a yellow fluorescence production gene in E. coli. The concentrations of glucose to which the promoter responds can be determined. Once the concentration is known, the promoter can be mutated so that it will be activated by varying concentrations of glucose and be used as a glucose sensor for people with diabetes. In the future, an insulin gene could be added to this system for use in insulin pumps, where specific glucose levels trigger insulin production in E. coli.\"",

We are targeting catechol for degradation into common metabolic intermediates of the Krebs Cycle by using xylE from Pseudomonas putida that codes for the protein catechol-2,3-dioxygenase.  Catechol-2,3-dioxygenase is being targeted into microcompartments, formed by engineered Aquifex aeolicus protein, lumazine synthase, to reduce cross-talk and increase concentration.  The complex will then be purified and applied to the tailings for catechol degradation.  By funnelling other pathways through catechol we can develop efficient methods for the decontamination of the tailings ponds.  Mms6 from Magnetospirillum magneticum removes heavy metals from solution by forming nanoparticles.  The Mms6 protein will be secreted from the cell into the tailings for the removal of metals such as iron and cobalt for creating an efficient bioremediation process.",

Currently, treatment for atherosclerosis involves preventative measures and surgical removal of plaque, angioplasty, and stent placement. We sought to develop an E. coli chassis delivering anti-atherosclerotic substances to the site of plaque in vasculature. Inflamed endothelial cells express VCAM-1, a receptor normally binds to the leukocyte antigen VLA-4. We attempted to express a VLA-4 fragment in E. coli, in order to selectively attach the cells to plaques. In vitro binding test uses inflamed murine endothelial cells which express VCAM-1. Results are pending. Our bacterial chassis also carries several inducible “effector” systems which, upon binding, release substances that facilitate plaque stabilization and regression. Effector systems include heme oxygenase-1, serum amyloid A and atrial natriuretic peptide. Expression of HO-1 in E. coli has been confirmed using spectroscopy. Testing for SAA secretion and ANP-induced gene expression in endothelial cells is ongoing.",

        "abstract": "\"The human circadian rhythm drives many important processes in the body in accordance with the sleep/wake cycle. A characteristic of this biological clock is the periodic oscillation of gene expression. Current parts in the Registry designed to regulate periodic oscillations of gene expression have shown limited success. Here we demonstrate a biological clock being standardised as a set of BioBrick parts. Our network is controlled by an engineered promoter, Plac/ara, which features both an activator and a repressor domain. This controls the production of downstream genes to activate other inducible promoters, pBAD and GlnAp2, eventually leading to the production of a repressor protein, lacI, which inhibits Plac/ara, resulting in oscillatory expression. This project shows the feasibility of standardising the biological clock in E. coli and grounds further development for applications in regulated drug/hormone delivery and ion channel control.\"",

        "abstract": "The goal of this project was to construct a biosensor for the hCG hormone consisting of S. cerevisiae. The human luteinizing hormone receptor (LH/CG), a GPCR with high affinity for hCG, was therefore expressed in yeast. The yeast strain used contains a yeast/human chimeric Gα-subunit, enabling coupling of the LH/CG-receptor with the pheromone pathway in yeast. Binding of hCG should consequently result in activation of the pathway. The genes tnaA and fmo, encoding tryptophanase and flavin-containing monooxygenase respectively, were introduced into the yeast strain. These enzymes catalyze the conversion of tryptophan to indigo. tnaA was set under the control of the pheromone induced FIG1 promoter and fmo was expressed constitutively. Hence, detection of hCG should result in the production of bio-indigo, the output signal of the biosensor. In order to ensure hCG to pass the cell wall, the gene CWP2, encoding a cell wall mannoprotein, was deleted.",

Knowing full well the problems caused by Celiac disease, and the affinity many others have for reducing gluten in their diets, we decided to design and create a yeast strain capable of both fermenting quality beer, and breaking down gluten. Our search for an enzyme capable of breaking down gluten and neutralizing its toxicity led us to the enzyme mutated by the 2011 UW IGEM team. The modified Kumamolisin-As has a maximal activity at a pH of 4 and would work well in the pH range of 5.2-5.5 found in beer. For expression in yeast we had to account for codon bias, and optimized the sequence so it could more easily be moved from a prokaryotic system to a eukaryotic one.",

We propose a novel design scheme highlighted in the notion of trade-off that synthetic networks could be obtained by a compromise between performance and robustness. Moreover, series of eligible strategies, which consist of various topologies and possible standard components such as BioBricks, provide multiple choices to facilitate the wet experiment procedure.

Over the summer we have been working on assembling riboswitches finely tuned by small molecules, which will act as the main power to drive two parts away from each other, and toggle switches pushed on and off while memorizing current state, which will play the role of giving birth to two 'different' kinds of bacteria in one colony. Furthermore, we have been modulating the toggle switch to produce a more balanced ratio and creatively integrating quorum sensing into our system to optimize our results.As to modeling, we have not only been building models of the movement in this 'amitosis', but also been collecting and analyzing data for a aptamers database for small molecules and corresponding genomic sequences and structures in guiding bacteria.",

The regio- and stereospecfic hydroxylations performed by CYPs are often difficult to do using conventional chemical methods and it can therefore be greatly beneficial to utilize our CyperMan as a small synthetic biology factory.CYPs from the plant CYP79 family produce small molecules called oximes. Oximes are toxic to fungus, as they inhibit the ability of the mitochondrial peroxidases to breakdown potentially harmful hydrogen peroxides. The oximes are produced from a variety of amino acids. As a proof of concept we aim at generating bacteria or CyperMen able to combat fungus on their own turf. The main goal is however to standardize different plant CYP79s and deliver them as BioBricks to iGEM.\"",

The human Adeno-Associated Virus (AAV) is a small, non-pathogenic, single-stranded DNA virus gaining increasing attention being both versatile and effective. Taking current knowledge into account, we generated a recombinant, modularized, BioBrick-compatible AAV 'Virus Construction Kit'. We provide parts for modified capsid proteins, targeting modules, tumor-specific promoters, and prodrug-activating enzymes as well as readily assembled vectors for gene delivery and production of non-replicative virus particles. The viral tropism is altered by N-terminal fusion or by loop replacement of the capsid proteins. Functionality of viruses constructed from our kit was demonstrated by fluorescent protein expression in infected cells and by prodrug-induced killing of tumor cells upon viral delivery of a thymidine kinase. Incorporating multiple layers of safety, we provide a general tool to the growing field of personalized medicine and demonstrate its use in tumor therapy.",

        "abstract": "Autogene is an innovative CAD tool used to automate the design process of synthetic DNA sequences. The first module, AutoPlasmid, leverages the power of cloud computing, sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms, and an expert curated feature database containing over 40,000 features to automatically annotate natural/synthetic DNA sequences, finding both perfect and imperfect matches. It also provides an effective solution to the Registry of Parts for annotation automation and pathogen sequence detection. The second module, AutoDesign, provides users with a drag-and-drop design environment to construct new sequences using user-imported features as well as those from our database. The third module AutoFab, which is still being developed, will provide users with guidelines of fabricating and optimizing their synthetic DNA. Compatible with other common bioinformatics tools such as ApE and capable of documenting in SBOL, genbank, and fasta formats, we hope that Autogene will allow synthetic biologists to take their research to the next level.",

To be particularly effective for these applications, fluorescent proteins must feature fast maturation and degradation rates, and these rates must be well-characterized and documented. The 2011 VT iGEM team has worked to find and characterize fluorescent proteins and degradation tags that more quickly degrade them.  Here, we present chemical and mathematical models based on two parameters, maturation and degradation rates, and in doing so, we explored difficulties in the process of characterizing parts. In conducting our experimentation, we tested fluorescent proteins with different degradation tags in Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae using automated fluorescent microscopy techniques, and then worked to determine a comprehensive, accurate mathematical basis for fluorescent protein characterization. \"",

        "abstract": "In digital electronics, a buffer amplifier is used to filter noise, isolate parts of a circuit, and make low signals lower/high signals higher. The ability to make many orthogonal buffer amps is critical to scaling up digital information processing in vivo. For our project, we first provide two mathematical proofs: (1) the buffer amp is \"equivalent\" to a bistable circuit, in that the ability to create one implies the ability to create the other, and (2) inhibitors with first-order binding cannot allow bistability (without other elements). This means that methods such as TALORs and many sRNA strategies cannot build a buffer amp. Thus, we test a new method: sequence-specific formation of a DNA-DNA-RNA triple helix to block a promoter. By using a dimer for the RNA, we can achieve second-order binding, allowing us to build sequence-specific buffer amps.",

We will submit constructs for the expression of reflectins in a variety of organisms.Our team is producing a report examining the impact of iGEM, focusing on innovation in the biotechnology industry.

First of all, we analyzed the function, structure and operation of the transcription factor MerR, a mercury-responsive regulator in detail via bioware experiments and modeling. Then appropriate topology candidates for proper bioreporters were carefully searched. We selected a candidate and re-designed genetic components to accomplish certain bioreporter function in need, which was verified by following bioware experiments. For bioabsorbents, we engineered MerR into a metal binding peptide. This was followed by inductive expression of engineered peptide on surface, periplasm and cytosol of E.coli. This reverse engineering method was then expanded to lead-responsive regulator, PbrR, to confirm the validness of this method. Results demonstrated that the procedure mentioned above is streamlined enough to construct valid whole-cell bioreporters and bioabsorbents of various heavy metals for field application in the near future.",

What we intend to do: (1) Make our designer cell safe, (2) Express specific cell surface receptors and antibodies to catch the virus, (3) Transduce the signal after viruses attached for feedback control, and (4) Remove the viruses along with ViroCatcher itself. 3. Anticipated results: the ViroCatcher is made safe for the bloodstream. When it is injected into the bloodstream, our ViroCatcher passively lies around letting viruses attach to it by using its 4 receptors: CD4 (for HIV), Integrin (for various viruses), Sialic Acid (for Influenza), and Antibodies (for Influenza). After enough viruses attach to it, or after a certain amount of time elapses, it removes itself from the bloodstream by calling macrophages to eat it up.",

To approach the second question, the Hell Cell subgroup developed BioBricks that allow a cell to survive harsh extraterrestrial conditions. Such a toolset could create a space-ready synthetic organism to perform useful functions off-world. For example, the Biomining branch attempted to engineer bacteria to recycle used electronics by degenerating silica and extracting metal ions in situ. The Venus Life subproject grappled with the third key astrobiological question by exploring Carl Sagan’s theory that life could exist in Venusian clouds. To this end, Venus Life designed a cell-cycle reporter to test for growth in aerosol within an adapted Millikan apparatus. Through this triad of projects, Stanford-Brown iGEM aimed to illuminate synthetic biology’s value as a tool for astrobiology.",

The final goal of our project is to induce a change in gene expression, more specifically to turn a gene on or off, in a living organism, in response to a light stimulus. For this we use light-sensitive DNA binding proteins (or light-sensitive proteins that activate DNA binding proteins) to convert a light input into a chosen output, for example fluorescence, through a reporter gene such as RFP. Demonstrating that the light-induced gene switch tool works in vivo would show that easier and faster tools can potentially be made available in several fields of biology, as such tools can induce more localized, more precise (time resolution and reversibility) and drastically faster genetic changes than currently used ones, thus allowing research to evolve even better.",

Tissue regeneration is composed of three primary processes: the regrowth of functional parenchymal tissue, the regrowth of support tissues, and the regrowth of vasculature to sustain the nascent tissue formation (angiogenesis). Although tissue engineering has offered several effective solutions to address the first two processes, our project attempts to build upon these ideas and develop a more cost-effective and robust method to promote angiogenesis at traumatic wound sites.  We have devised a circuit to be incorporated in a yeast chassis that efficiently expresses two vital angiogenic proteins--vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and platelet derived growth factor (PDGF-B)--in a sequential and time-dependent manner that approximates the natural cascade of growth factor release in the human body. We also intend to submit a Biobrick-compatible yeast plasmid backbone for future use.\"",

Our goal is to show that spatio-temporal structures can be generated by the behavior of a genetic regulatory network. We implement the model by means of several biobricks. We construct a self activating module and correspondingly an inhibitory one.  Self-activation dynamics is given by the las operon, while the inhibitory part is provided by the lux operon. Quorum sensing and diffusion of AHL provide the reaction-diffusion mechanism responsible for the formation of Turing patterns. The importance of our work relies on the fact that we show that the  action of the morphogenes as originally proposed by Turing is equivalent to the effect of  diffusion of chemicals interacting with the synthetic network, which accounts for the reactive part, a possibility implicit in Turing’s original work in the context of  morphogenesis of biological patterns.",

We set to provide new evidence for this cell-to-cell communication and to allow the synthetic biology community to harness its potential for amorphous computing and metabolic engineering. We developed and characterized new B.subtilis BioBricks designed to validate this finding by testing a wide range of molecules that could potentially travel through the nanotubes and be detected via signal amplification. We worked on molecules of different size and nature to best characterize the transfer. Modeling suggests that we will be able to follow the diffusion through the nanotube network by fluorescence microscopy. TuBe or not TuBe? Our ongoing experiments will shed light on this elusive question. \"",

We put GFP equipped with degradation tags in downstream to illuminate our numbers and change them quickly as well. Considering our engineering background, we accordingly employ cell immobilization to build our device. Engineering bacteria have been embedded in intra-hallow calcium alginate microcapsules and in PDMDAAC-NaCS microcapsules, respectively. In addition, 3D CAD design is performed for a perfect device.\r\nOur genetic circuits vary in length and RBS strength, leading to different durations of time delay for GFP expression. This inspired us to extend our work last year. By altering the strength of RBS at five grades, another five circuits have been built. After the induction by arabinose, the duration of response time for GFP expression increases as the strength of RBS declines, bringing about a time-course display.",

        "abstract": "Formaldehyde is a common harmful chemical, and it has a bad effect in relatively low concentration. (For example, in agricultural chemicals, in disinfectant at hospitals and in paint of building materials) Also, since formaldehyde is mass-produced in factories, it is highly possible to exceed over the permissible amount in the environment. This year, in Japan, the detection of formaldehyde in Tone river became an issue. (1) We planned to create E.coli with an ability to　detect and detoxify formaldehyde named Chef Ant E.coli. About detection, we try to visualize formaldehyde by ligating regulated promoter, frmR and GFP. Moreover we plan to overexpress two enzymes in Chef Ant E.coli. First, formaldehyde dehydrogenase decomposes formaldehyde to formic acid. The gene of formaldehyde dehydrogenase is from Pseudomonas Putida. Second, formic acid dehydrogenase converts formic acid to CO2 and H2O. The gene of formic acid dehydrogenase is from Methylbacterium extorquens.",

We are engineering Neurospora crassa, a highly efficient cellulose metabolizer, to produce an excess of fatty acids by both inhibiting beta oxidation and up-regulating fatty acid synthesis by the one-step replacement of the FadD gene with a thioesterase gene. We are testing the growth of Neurospora on a variety of waste substances and are developing an efficient chemical esterification method to convert the fatty acids into fatty acid methyl esters, a common biodiesel requiring no changes to current fuel delivery infrastructure.  Neurospora crassa's broad substrate preferences give it unique advantages for bioproduction from cellulose. We have therefore developed an efficient and reliable system for modular bioengineering of Neurospora including a starter kit of basic reusable parts with the intent of creating a novel chassis for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology. \"",

The WashU iGEM team hopes to address this issue by creating a transgenic strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (baker's yeast) that produces beta-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A. The WashU team created four DNA constructs for homologous recombination into the S. cerevisiae genome that will catalyze the production of beta-carotene. Each construct consisted of a gene encoding an enzyme from Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, a bacterium that produces beta-carotene. Three of the constructs encode for enzymes in the metabolic pathway required for beta-carotene production, while a fourth enzyme cleaves beta-carotene to form beta-ionone, a rose-scented compound used in the fragrance industry. Additionally, the WashU team has established spectraphotometric assays to detect beta-carotene and beta-ionone in yeast extract. Although we have yet to successfully incorporate these four genes into S. cerevisiae, we have prepared all four constructs and biobricked these genes for future use.",

A genetic circuit has been designed and characterized to establish a bacterial 'population-control' device in E. coli based on the well-known quorum-sensing system from Vibrio fischeri, which autonomously regulates the density of an E. coli population. The cell density is influenced by the expression levels of a killer gene (ccdB) in our device. We have successfully controlled the expression levels of ccdB by site-directed mutagenesis of a luxR promoter (lux pR) and error-prone PCR of gene luxR, and we are building a database for a series of mutation sites corresponding to different cell densities and fluorescent intensities. An artificial neural network will be built to model and predict the cell density of an E. coli population. This work can serve as a foundation for future advances involving fermentation industry and information processing.",

The need for low-cost, portable and easy-to-use dosimeters became apparent as radiation measurements could only be conducted at sparsely-distributed installations and the values reported infrequently. We have decided to tackle the issue by building a biological dosimeter. Focus is placed on modularly transferring radiation response and DNA repair genes from the extremophilic bacterium Deinococcus radiodurans to the well-characterized, easily cultivable chassis Escherichia coli. The native DNA damage detection and repair systems of E. coli will be also modified to efficiently sense ionizing radiation through detection of the resultant DNA damage. Finally, detection will be connected to visible outputs such as color pigment production, resulting in a biological device capable of detecting ionizing radiation and alerting users to it through color change. \"",

        "abstract": "Large-scale production and purification of recombinant proteins by cell cultures represent a key-area in manufacturing field. The production  process still has several drawbacks affecting cost/efficiency. In this work, three modular systems were designed to overcome some of these bottlenecks. A library of self-inducible promoters was built and characterized to start the peptide production at a desired culture density, without expensive inducer molecules. Two standard integrative vectors were realized to insert BioBrick parts in user-defined positions of E. coli or S. cerevisiae genome, to ensure genetic stability without using selection markers. Finally, two promising techniques were combined for an 'in-cell' protein purification: PolyHydroxyAlkanoate (PHA) granules were used as a substrate for PHA-binding peptides (Phasins) fused to the target protein, thus replacing affinity resins/columns and tags, while a pH-based self-cleaving peptide (Intein) was used instead of a protease cleavage site. These solutions are modular and provide useful BioBrick parts for other applications.",

Then, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii will be transfected with the with the designed plasmid.

Penn State's team project designed and constructed a genetic circuit introduced into E. coli bacterial cells, in order to rapidly detect and report the presence of harmful ionizing radiation. We are working to create a robust and reliable biosensor that utilizes the lambda phage lytic-lysogenic switch as the radiation sensor. When the sensor detects radiation, it triggers one of three fast acting reporters we developed based on the concept developed by Imperial College's 2010 iGEM team. Each of the reporters features a different enzyme/substrate reaction (beta-galactosodise/beta-D-galactose, beta-glucurodinase/beta-D-glucuronide or C23O/catechol). We believe that the final construct may have the potential to rival current radiation detection methods, such as digital dosimeters.",

A SAT problem is formed by connecting true-false variables with OR to form clauses and connecting clauses with AND.  The goal is to determine if true-false values can be assigned to each variable to make the overall logical expression true. Our designed system uses frameshift suppressor tRNAs as inputs and frameshift suppressor leaders (FSLs) that process the inputs to enable the translation of fluorescent proteins exactly when an appropriate combination of inputs is present. The results illustrate the potential of engineered living cells to evaluate challenging mathematical problems. Our project also explored two aspects of synthetic biology education:  a survey and analysis of public opinion and teachers’ knowledge of synthetic biology and the design and construction of physical models of a frameshift suppressor.",

By sequencing the genomes of species of the radiation-resistant Deinococcus genus, we hope to identify genes that may be responsible for increased protection against superoxide radicals and ionizing radiation. We are also performing RNA-seq experiments to ascertain what genes are upregulated by radiation exposure. We also realize that there are significant gains to be made on the software side of synthetic biology, so we are working with others to code tools to integrate into the Registry and into iGEM teams' biobricking pipelines.\"",

        "abstract": "Building on a long-standing French fascination for frogs, we wanted to spread this enthusiasm to the world of synthetic biology by introducing a new, vertebrate chassis to the community: Xenopus tropicalis. This leap towards multicellular biological engineering required new tools, so we first developed a new set of frog compatible vectors, biobricked tissue specific promoters and a new technique to assemble them in a single shot. To benefit from tissue compartmentalisation, we created a synthetic, orthogonal hormonal system using the plant molecule auxin. We also investigated E. coli/Xenopus interfacing, effectively creating a synthetic ecosystem. We modelled our system at the organism scale, using a multi-level and multi-technique approach. Finally, working with whole animals during iGEM brought a load of difficult ethical questions regarding animal biotechnologies and experimentation. This led us to wonder: Are we a chassis?",

The EPFL iGEM project aims to stop malaria propagation by acting on the vector: the mosquito. We are engineering Asaia, a bacterium that naturally lives in the mosquito's gut, to express an immunotoxin that can prevent the malaria agent Plasmodium falciparum from infecting the mosquito, thereby eliminating the transmission of this parasite to humans. Asaia is an organism that is easy to grow and genetically manipulate. We are establishing Asaia as a new chassis so that future iGEM teams can quickly and efficiently engineer new and more potent Asaia strains. This will provide the synthetic biology community with a useful tool in the fight against malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases.",

To battle this problem, a purification strategy was developed in which arsenic, zinc or copper are removed from metal-polluted water and sediment. In this approach Escherichia coli bacteria accumulate metal ions from solutions, after which they produce gas vesicles and start floating. This biological device encompasses two integrated systems: one for metal accumulation, the other for metal-induced buoyancy. The uptake and storage system consists of a metal transporter and metallothioneins (metal binding proteins). The buoyancy system is made up of a metal-induced promoter upstream of a gas vesicle gene cluster. This device can be changed to scavenge for any compound by altering the accumulation and the induction modules. The combination of both systems enables the efficient decontamination of polluted water and sediment in a biological manner.",

        "abstract": "Objective - Naturally occurring organisms using polystyrene as their sole source of carbon have been recently identified, by analysing the occurrence of polystyrene breakdown products. However these metabolites accumulate very slowly, explaining why polystyrene is so persistent in the environment. Polystyrene can currently be recycled, but due to the low density of the majority of polystyrene products it is economically unfavourable, due to the high energy demands. If inexpensive biological degradation can be achieved this would assist recycling, but we also hope to use products of this reaction to make useful organic chemicals. \r\n\r\nAim - To construct BioBricks from the genes encoding enzymes involved in this pathway and manipulate their expression and properties to maximise the rate of polystyrene degradation. \r\n\r\nHypothesis - genes encoding the enzymes of the polystyrene breakdown pathway can be isolated and expressed in a host microorganism and the rate of the process increased by genetic manipulation.",

If we are successful in engineering Lactobacillus lactis, a Gram positive bacteria to express and secrete Monellin, we will be able to produce dairy products low in poly-saccharide-based sweeteners, radically reducing the calorific content of these products. In order to be able to control the level of expression in this system, we plan to develop a regulatory system(s) that simulates a logical AND gate in response to two bioloical inputs. We plan to use the decreasing pH during curdling and the addition of nicin as the two inputs. To achieve the AND gate we will be using the CRE gene in combination with loxP sites. By placing the loxP sites appropriately, we will create an expression system that will produce the Monellin in a window of conditions.",

(Cereghino and Cregg, 2000). The 2010 Georgia State team believes P. pastoris would be an excellent chassis for the iGEM competition. The purpose of this project is to provide a tool box of parts necessary for the genetic manipulation of this organism. These parts include a variety of promoter systems, multiple selectivity options, and a plasmid backbone. In addition, the tool box will be used to produce a flu virus antigen in P. pastoris as a representation of the applicability of this system. These contributions will enable future users to maximize the use and further explore the incredible potential P. pastoris has to offer.",

The problems are reduction in land available for food production, relatively low levels of CO2 biofixation, and large biomass requirements. Our project aims to overcome these problems by utilizing E. coli for the production of biodiesel (C-12 fatty acids) and bioethanol. There have been a number of examples of biofuel production in E. coli; however 30-40% of production cost is based on media costs. Our project will surmount these high production costs by engineering the cyanobacteria, Synechocystis PCC6803, to secrete large quantities of glucose that will feed our biofuel-producing E .coli. Cyanobacteria and E.coli will be co-cultivated to allow the mutual transfer of carbon to produce biofuels.  This project provides an efficient means for producing biofuels without a carbon source.  It will also create a novel cooperative system between bacterial species that may have further industrial implications.\"",

In contrast, in vitro synthetic DNA circuits utilizing strand displacement have demonstrated complex digital logic with reliable and scalable behaviors in a small base-pair footprint. The possible adaption of such circuits into cellular environments can amplify the scale and complexity of biological circuits, broadening synthetic biology’s application space.\r\n\r\nOur project leverages strand displacement to create a process technology that supports multi-input sensing, sophisticated information processing, and precisely-regulated actuation in mammalian cells. We construct RNA strand displacement circuits that detect endogenous mRNA, perform digital logic computation, and output desired proteins through programmable RNA interference pathways.  \r\n\r\nWe envision in-vivo RNA strand displacement as a new foundation for scaling up complexity in engineered biological systems, with applications in biosynthesis, biomedical diagnostics and therapeutics.",

The bacterium Rhizobium etli, during its symbiotic relationship with the common bean Phaseolus vulgaris, can transform nitrogen gas into ammonia in a process called nitrogen fixation. In exchange the plant provides the bacteria with carbon sources and a protected niche inside its root, where Rhizobium etli reaches a hypoxic state. We will exploit this microenvironment to produce hydrogen in Rhizobium etli introducing a pathway assembled with elements from Clostridium acetobutylicum, Desulfovibrio africanus and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, while maintaining nitrogen fixation.The two goals of our project are to make Rhizobium etli a powerful agent in environmental protection by nitrifying soils and producing hydrogen from solar energy, and to standardize the work in Rhizobials.\"",

Unfortunately, the efficiency of some of these reactions may render their applications logistically unrealistic. The cellulosome scaffolding protein produced by Clostridium thermocellum has been shown to significantly increase the efficiency of cellulose degradation. The scaffolding protein can be reduced in size and adapted for the cell surface of Escherichia coli. Different cohesion sites on the new cell surface display protein can also be introduced to allow for attachment of desired enzymes. Future applications would include producing a collection of distinct versions of the scaffolding protein for unique arrangements and concentrations of enzymes, enabling construction of an extra-cellular assembly line for a variety of multi-enzymatic reactions. This would lay the foundation for making previously infeasible applications of reactions possible through increased efficiency.",

        "abstract": "We daily double-click the icons to open the files or to exert the program: this is clearly distinguished from the single click, which is often for selecting or highlighting the program. This year, iGEM CHIBA is constructing genetic double-click system whose output is released only when the input (inducing agent) is given twice within a limited time. To discriminate double-click from two separated single-clicks, the 1st input is to be memorized temporarily. If the 2nd input is added before the memory gets lost, output will be produced. If the 2nd input is not added within the given time, the system will be reset to the original state. This mechanism could work as a sort of safety device; by requiring the 2nd 'confirmation' input, one can drastically reduce, or even eliminate, the frequency of false-inputs. This system could be useful in operating the potent or potentially-hazardous biochemical processes.",

Many strains of E.coli possess flagella which are controlled by a key group of genetic factors for assembly and chemotactic control.  Regulation of these genes can be harnessed by creating combinations of promoters and individual components of the flagella apparatus. By promoting the synthesis of E.coli flagella genes and flagella activity under various conditions, such as salt concentration, nitrate concentration, pH and temperature, we can measure changes in flagella rotation and frequency.  This frequency can be translated into an audible range, which indicates the bacteria’s distress and providing the researcher with a bacterial response to controlled growth conditions.   Our system provides a new mechanism of bacterial communication with the researcher, through a spectrum of musical outputs.  As such, we have named our system E. musici.",

To meet this challenge, we engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFPs), which are tailored to bind to DNA with high specificity, enabling precise genome editing. Our group has developed a foundational technology for synthesizing nearly 50,000 unique ZFPs using chip-based DNA synthesis based on bioinformatic analysis and for identifying the best binder using a novel genomically encoded 1-hybrid genetic selection scheme in a massively multiplexed fashion. Further, we employed multiplex automated genome engineering (MAGE) for facile editing of the E. coli genome enabling rapid modification of ZFP target sites, gene knockouts and silent codon substitutions. These tools allow for low-cost creation of ZFPs targeting any endogenous human gene, which will increase the accessibility of customized genome editing for gene therapy.\"",

We designed our genetic constructs using state-of-the-art optimization techniques, simulations, and data from our parts characterization experiments. In order to realize this design, we developed an extensive yeast toolkit including promoters, UTRs, and vectors. We synthesized the violacein pathway, which, combined with our vitamins and intermediate metabolites, represent a new set of yeast reporters.

After inducing the vector genome (generated by bottom-up or top-down approach) into BL21 DE3 E.coli strain, we applied a co-transformed therapeutic DNA (namely a cosmid with a capacity of 40-50 kb) for mass production of our targeted gene therapy vectors containing the desired genes to be delivered. With the targeted biobrick immediating the attachment and RGD domain immediating the internalization of the targeted vector, we are able to accomplish the targeted gene therapy.",

Furthermore, large quantities of these substances are needed because of their distribution throughout the body. This, coupled with expensive production and especially purification, imposes a great burden on health systems. We aim to develop a safe and cost-effective biological delivery system for biopharmaceuticals, which would increase the quality of patients' lives, because it would minimize the number of required procedures. This type of delivery system would increase patient compliance to the therapy while the local administration will reduce the side-effects associated with current treatments. We plan to design the mammalian cells-based delivery system to be regulated by the digital logic from the outside.",

The ultimate goal of E. coli Automatic Directed Evolution Machine (E.ADEM) project is to manage the power of evolution, by engineering a robust system framework that can automatically create anything we want in synthetic biology, from various types of parts to complex systems. Each demand can be converted into designing a scoring function to give the evolution process a direction. E.ADEM is designed by implementing evolutionary algorithm back into biology. The core of E.ADEM is a self-adaptive controller that can adjust variation rate and selection pressure, based on fitness score, population size and average fitness score calculated by a quorum sensing device. After comprehensive measurement using constitutive promoter family stimulus signals and modeling of the components, a prototype machine is built. Modular design and PoPS device boundary standard will ensure the extensibility and universality of the machine.",

        "abstract": "Some eukaryotic cells, such as white blood cells, have the amazing ability to sense specific external chemical signals, and move toward those signals. This behavior, known as chemotaxis, is a fundamental biological process crucial to such diverse functions as development, wound healing and immune response. Our project focuses on using a synthetic biology approach to manipulate signaling pathways that mediate chemotaxis. We are attempting to reprogram the movements that the cells undergo by altering the guidance and movement machinery of these cells in a modular way. For example, can we steer them to migrate toward new signals? Can we make cells move faster? Slower?  We hope to better understand how chemotaxis works, and eventually build cells that can perform useful tasks. Imagine, for example, therapeutic cell-bots that could home to a directed site in the body and execute complex, user-defined functions (e.g., kill tumors, deliver drugs, guide stem cell migration).",
