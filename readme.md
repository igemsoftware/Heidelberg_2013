Django stuff
=============

Because we all LOVE packages (AND LOTS OF THEM), here is the list of stuff you will need to run everything. Will also give suggestion to install that works on ubuntu or sometimes with our beloved PIP (Ilia does not like PIP though -_-, else you'll have to check the documentation of the library yourself):

Main packages
--------------
* Python (2.7)
* Django (version 1.5.1.)
* MySql
* MySql - Python connector

sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb

Django packages
---------------
* __django_evolution__: because who doesn't like pokemons that evolve 

sudo pip install django_evolution

* __dajax__: Nice library to pass ajax requests via python functions

sudo pip install django-dajax

* __dajaxice__: Similar to dajax (same project) but nice for integrating to manually writen javascript functions

sudo pip install django-dajaxice


Other stuff that is loaded by some of our python functions:
-----------------------------------------------------------
* __Requests__:Great library to do simple http requests!

sudo pip install requests

* __Biopython__: Just like bioperl but not in a crappy language!

sudo apt-get install python-biopython
